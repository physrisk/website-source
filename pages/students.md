<strong>Currently</strong> we are offering internship position for the
summer of 2024. It is supported by the Research Council of Lithuania. Find

for the upcoming summer!<strong></div>

We are always happy to accept students from different backgrounds
(physics, mathematics, social sciences) who would be interested in complex
socio-economic systems. Having good skills in programming or mathematics
would be extremely helpful as well as having a good grasp of statistical
physics or social sciences, but these are surely not mandatory as with
proper determination and with enough effort anything can be learnt.

If you are interested, feel free to [contact us]({filename}/pages/about.md).
We will try to schedule a meeting to find a problem you could tackle.
