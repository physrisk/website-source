On this blog we discuss a variety of [topics](/tags.html) related to the research
interests of our Complex Physical and Social Systems group in [Vilnius University](https://www.vu.lt/)
[Faculty of Physics](https://www.ff.vu.lt/)
[Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy](https://www.ff.vu.lt/tfai). We try
to cover research done by us as well as related research carried out by other
groups from around the world. The considered
[topics](/tags.html) are
rather well encompassed by the term Physics of Risk, hence the name and the
logo (it imitates the phrase "more physics, less risk") of this blog.
Originally this term was a title of EU COST project,
which ran from 2004 to 2008 (two members of our group were part of this
project).

This blog was created while executing EU structural fund project "[Mokslas.
Mokslininkai.
Visuomenė.](https://mokslasplius.lt/mmv/)"
(en. "Science. Scientists. Society."; ran from 2006 to 2008) and further
extended during Inogeb-1 project "[Mokslas verslui ir
visuomenei](https://mokslasplius.lt/mvv/)"
(en.  "Science for business and society"; ran from 2009 to 2011).  During
these projects articles for this blog were written by various members of our
group, as well as by some authors who no longer work with us - V. Daniūnas,
M. Alaburda, T. Meškauskas.

We are part of the [mokslasplius.lt](https://mokslasplius.lt) website
portal.
