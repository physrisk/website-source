The
most active and well known scientists contributing towards FuturICT
project have organized their ideas into few articles, which discuss the
current situation in contemporary complex social system modeling. These
articles we published in a special issue of "The European Physical
Journal Special Topics". Most of the articles are available for free,
thus we invite you to familiarize yourselves with them.
