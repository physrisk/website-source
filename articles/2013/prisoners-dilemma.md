Previously we wrote about
mathematical "puzzle" originating from a TV game (see [the description
of the Monty Hall
problem](/teaching-math-in-a-different-way "Teaching math in a different way")).
This time we shall consider the opposite case - the mathematical "game"
used as a base for a TV game. Watch a fragment of the "[Golden
Balls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Balls)" final stage called
"Split or steal".

The game is very simple, yet it possesses no correct solution or optimal
strategy. Interestingly enough it can also be used as model for
understanding social behavior of humans \[cite
