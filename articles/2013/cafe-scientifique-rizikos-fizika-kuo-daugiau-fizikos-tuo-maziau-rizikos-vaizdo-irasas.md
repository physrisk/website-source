So
[Cafe Scientifique
event]({filename}/articles/2013/cafe-scientifique-rizikos-fizika.md)
has happened. Everything went rather smooth and it seems, by listening
to the live comments and from [the impressions on the
blogosphere](https://enorca.blogspot.com/2013/11/mokslo-kavine.html),
that it was fun.

For the first time in history of the Cafe Scientifique organized by
Student's Scientific Association of Faculty of Physics of Vilnius
University the event was recorded
on the video (special thanks to the
[webseminarai.lt](https://webseminarai.lt) team)! Which very useful to us
as we can now share for all people who are interested in the popular
side of Physics of Risk. We invite everyone interested to view the video
(though note that everything is presented in
Lithuanian)<!--more-->.
