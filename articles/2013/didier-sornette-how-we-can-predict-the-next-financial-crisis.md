If one would start speaking
about the dragon kings and black swans, many people would think that the
one is talking about the fairy tales. But these terms are used then
speaking about the events in the financial markets! Black swans are
rare, but observable in the nature. Dragon kings are only observed in
the fairy tales. So we would be amused if we would see the black swan
with our own eyes, yet if we would see the dragon king we would be
completely shocked. In nature these kinds of event are extremely rare
and improbable, while in the financial markets we see these kind of
events frequently enough. Bellow you can find a talk by Didier Sornette
(taken from
[ted.com](http://www.ted.com/talks/didier_sornette_how_we_can_predict_the_next_financial_crisis.html),

predict.<!--more-->
