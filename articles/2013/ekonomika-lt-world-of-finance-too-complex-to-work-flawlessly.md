Rare
events tend to make our everyday lives somewhat more complicated. The
problem is that usually those event are unavoidable, but the nice thing
is that they are extremely rare. In certain system some small
deviations, which occur more frequently than the aforementioned "rare
events", may be amplified in a way to cause a catastrophe. The financial
markets are on of such systems - they are intrinsically highly complex.
The article developing these ideas was published on
[ekonomika.lt](https://www.ekonomika.lt/naujiena/finansu-pasaulis-pernelyg-sudetingas-kad-veiktu-sklandziai-43427.html),
thus we would like to suggest reading it (though note that the article
is written in Lithuanian).
