Recently while zapping over TV
channels one program on the Discovery Science channel caught my
attention. So have started watching "Weird connections" episode "Law of
the Urinal" out of pure general interest. Yet after finishing watching
it I thought that it should prove to be very interesting in a context of
Physics of Risk. Thus I would like to encourage you to watch it on the
Discovery Science channel (as far as I know it is being shown again from
time to time) or on the [vimeo.com website](http://vimeo.com/2266845).
