We have previously wrote about the
[elementary kinetic
models](/elementary-kinetic-exchange-models "Elementary kinetic models").
Now we would like to put them to a certain use - namely we would like to
model wealth distributions. The problem is that the stationary
distribution of the elementary kinetic models, as we have shown before,
is Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, while the empirical distribution of
wealth has a power law tail (see [Fig. 1](#attachment_2581)). Therefore
we will need some essential modifications to replicate the empirical
distribution.<!--more-->

One of the keys to success in this case is the introduction of the more
realistic saving mechanism. Previously we have assumed that the saving
propensity is fixed - namely that all particles store the same amount of
energy. Yet a more realistic assumption may be made - particles may save
the energy based on the proportions! Namely the can save a certain
percentage of current energy to use in the future interactions. For the
sake of simplicity let us start by assuming that this saving propensity
is the same for all particles and equals \\\(  \kappa \\\). Now one can
introduce it into the reshuffling model:


\begin{equation}
 \Delta w\_{ij} = (1-\kappa) \[ (1-\varepsilon) w\_i(t) -\varepsilon w\_j(t) \] . 
\end{equation}


One can convince himself that the stationary probability density
function (abbr. PDF) of this model is given by the Gamma distribution
\[cite id="Patriarca2013AJP"\]:


\begin{equation}
 p(w) \sim w^{n-1} \exp(- n w), 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  n = 1 +\frac{3 \kappa}{1-\kappa} \\\). In physics similar
shape of distribution is seen for the ideal gas particle energies in the
\\\(  d \\\)-dimensional case, where \\\(  n \\\) equals half of the
spatial dimension \\\(  n=d/2 \\\). It should be pretty straightforward
to relate the abstraction of saving propensity and the dimensionality of
the system: \\\(  \kappa = \frac{d-2}{d+4} \\\). The impact of the
proportional saving propensity can be seen in the interactive HTML5
applet below.

Note that in this model the stationary distribution still behaves as
exponential in the limit of large energies, while we want to obtain
power-law behavior! Though it is note hard to modify this model to have
this kind of asymptotic behavior. One just needs to assume that agents
may have heterogeneous saving propensity! In such case \\\(  \Delta w\_{ij} \\\) is given by


\begin{equation}
 \Delta w\_{ij} = (1-\kappa\_i) (1-\varepsilon) w\_i(t) -(1-\kappa\_j) \varepsilon w\_j(t) , 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  \kappa\_n \\\) are the saving propensities of different
particles, which are uniformly distributed in the interval \\\( \[0,1\] \\\) (this randomization is done during model initialization). This
simple assumption is enough to reproduce the power law tail! This result
suggests that agent heterogeneity is a very powerful and important tool.
You can see the power-law distribution (note that the plot is log-log)
in the HTML5 applet below.

How did this happen? Why we have obtained power-law distribution under
so simple assumptions? The answer lies in a fact that Gamma distribution
is still a correct approximation of any single particle energy
distribution. Yet the sum over each different particles energy
distribution yields a power-law PDF. Mathematically, if \\\( \kappa\_i \\\) are evenly distributed in \\\(  \[0,1\] \\\) and the number
of particles, \\\(  N \\\), is sufficiently large, one can obtain that


\begin{equation}
 p(w) = \frac{1}{N} \sum\_{i=1}^N C\_i w^{\frac{3\kappa\_i}{1-\kappa\_i}} \exp\left\[-\left(1+\frac{3\kappa\_i}{1-\kappa\_i}\right) w \right\] \propto w^{-2} . 
\end{equation}


One can understand this visually by looking into the [Fig.
2](#attachment_2582). Here all particles were grouped into the groups,
which have similar \\\(  \kappa \\\) values. As you can see, red
monotonic curves, the energy distribution in each interval (except the
last one, \\\(  \kappa\_i \in (0.9,1\] \\\)) is rather well
approximated by a Gamma distribution (subfigure (a)). If we would group
the particles of the last interval into a smaller groups (\\\(  (0.9,0.91\] \\\), \\\(  (0.91, 0.92\] \\\), \\\(  (0.92, 0.93\] \\\) and etc.) we
would see that each of this smaller groups once again have a
distribution of energies similar to the Gamma distribution (subfigure
(b)). Yet the sum over all particles has a power-law tail and is given
by blue dashed curve.

distributions of particles in certain intervals of κ values, which is
approximately Gamma distributions except for the last one. While in the
subfigure (b) we see that if last interval of κ values is broken up into
smaller intervals, then the particles in those smaller intervals once
again have Gamma-like distrubtions of their energy. Figure taken from an

Only small detail is left to be reproduced - [empirical
distribution](#attachment_2581) has a "bump". This may be introduced
into the model by assuming that certain fraction of particles, \\\( p\_0 \\\), has a fixed saving propensity, \\\(  \kappa\_0 \\\), while all
other particles have a random saving propensity. In such case one Gamma
distribution in the sum is strongly emphasized thus forming a "bump",
while the sum over others allows to obtain the power-law tail.

Therefore by playing with \\\(  p\_0 \\\) and \\\(  \kappa\_0 \\\)
parameters one can reproduce the empirical wealth distribution \[cite
id="Patriarca2013AJP"\]. The only drawback is that the exponent of
power-law tail is fixed and set to 2.
