Recently I have discovered
an online education system [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). While
browsing through the available courses I noticed one named "Social and
Economic Networks: Models and Analysis". Sadly it was already six weeks
into the eight week program, so I was not able to formally complete it.
Yet the knowledge I have obtained by viewing videos of this course
enabled me to prepare couple of posts for this website.

Previously, I have already written about the
[Erdos-Renyi](/erdos-renyi-model "Erdos-Renyi model on Physics of Risk")
and the
[Watts-Strogatz](/watts-strogatz-model "Watts-Strogatz model on Physics of Risk")
("small world" networks) network formation models. This time I'll write
about the Barabasi-Albert model ("scale-free"
networks).<!--more-->

The essence of the Barabasi-Albert model
----------------------------------------

Previously described
[Erdos-Renyi](/erdos-renyi-model "Erdos-Renyi model on Physics of Risk")
and
[Watts-Strogatz](/watts-strogatz-model "Watts-Strogatz model on Physics of Risk")
network formation models have very the in common with the real life
networks. The latter is just random graph, while the former is only able
to reproduce the "small world" properties. Both these models posses
characteristic scale, while the real life networks do not have such.
They are scaleless and posses power law degree distributions.

The power law degree distributions were reproduced by Barabasi and
Albert by using the preferential attachment algorithm. In this algorithm
the new nodes select old nodes, with which they will form links (edges),
based on their degree (number of links the nodes has). Due to this
preference for the higher degree nodes the algorithm is called
preferential attachment. Due to this preference the nodes with higher
degrees will further incrase, while the lower degree nodes will stay
with the same degree. This effect in the sociology is known as Matthew
effect or "rich gets richer" effect. In the empirical data this effect
is observed as power law distribution.

How to understand this effect? The internet proves to be an excellent
example. There are couple of very well known and influential website on
the web (Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo, BBC and etc), while there are lots of
less well known (or completely unknown) websites. Those influential
websites are highly cited, and thus more easily found than the ones
which are less known. Thus the average internet user, then creating his
own website, will surely reference the well known websites more than
those which are less known. This is naturally expected not only due to
the fact that he cannot know as much less known websites, but also due
to the fact that majority of users see the popular website as some kind
of authority figure. Consequently the already popular website will get
more popular, while the less well known will remain behind them in terms
of popularity. Similar situation is observed in the scientific citation
networks and also in the internet connections (see the
[figure](#attachment_2483) below).

Taking the above into account we can mathematically express the
probability that the node \\\(  i \\\) will gain another degree as


\begin{equation}
 p\_i = \frac{k\_i^\alpha}{\sum\_j k\_j^\alpha} . 
\end{equation}


In the above \\\(  k\_i \\\) is a degree of the node \\\(  i \\\), \\\( \alpha \\\) is an influence of the popularity (the larger it gets the more
larger degrees are preferred), while the division by the sum over all
old nodes is required to have a normalized probability.

In general case before applying the preferential attachment random
connection algorithm one needs to have some set of the initial nodes.
After creating this set (and edges between the nodes in it) we can apply
the algorithm by creating one or more nodes at each step. It is usually
required that the number of nodes created per step should be less than
the size of initial set of nodes. In our applet below we present the
simplest case - the initial set consists of two nodes and one node per
step is being added.

Essential properties of the Barabasi-Albert model and scale-free networks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all the distribution of degrees is a power law \[cite
id="Albert2002RevModPhys"\]:


\begin{equation}
 p(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}, 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  \lambda \\\) is the slope of the power law function (\\\( \lambda=3 \\\), when \\\(  \alpha=1 \\\)).

The average path length in the scale-free networks (generated using
Barabasi-Albert model) is smaller than in a case of the
[Watts-Strogatz](/watts-strogatz-model "Watts-Strogatz model on Physics of Risk")
model \[cite id="Albert2002RevModPhys"\]:


\begin{equation}
 l \sim \frac{\ln N}{\ln \ln N}. 
\end{equation}


Therefore it should be evident that the scale-free networks are
ultra-small world networks.

And lastly, the scale-free network has a large clusterization
coefficient. Larger than the one observed in the
[Erdos-Renyi](/erdos-renyi-model "Erdos-Renyi model on Physics of Risk")
networks \[cite id="Albert2002RevModPhys"\].

Interactive HTML5 applet
------------------------

Bellow you should find a HTML5 applet, which allows you to generate the
scale-free networks (with different \\\(  \alpha \\\)). By using left
mouse click you should be able to pan the figure, while using the mouse
wheel you can zoom in and out of the figure. The network can be
generated manually node by node ("Add node" button) or automatically at
the speed of one node per second ("Generate" button).

On the left panel we plot the scale-free graph itself, while on the
right panel you can see the probability density of the network's nodes'
degrees (note that both axes are logarithmic).

Note that with a large number of nodes (100 or more) the applet might
free and disrupt your browser operation, thus you should handle the
applet with care. If you would like to analyze or generate large network
consider downloading [Gephi](http://gephi.org/) or obtaining other
similar software packages.

Previously, on the old Physics of Risk, we used a Lithuanian translated
Java applet, originally created with NetLogo, to provide an interactive
demonstration. The original, english, applet (created by Uri Wilensky)
can be found on the [NetLogo Model
Library](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/PreferentialAttachment).
