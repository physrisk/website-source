The
quantitative comparison of economic growth of various states is still an
ambiguous task. Economists and statisticians use various estimates of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) taking into account inflation, population,
exchange rates etc. Here we present a graphical comparison of GDP growth
of various states aimed at the estimation of relative input of various
states into regions or the world economy and at the measure of economic
convergence. We choose the estimate of GDP in common currency US dollars
calculated in current prices and current exchange rates. In order to
compare different size states we use GDP normalized per capita. Such
data is available at the [World Bank
Database](http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/the-future-of-the-open-data-catalog "WB open data").<!--more-->

We do plot the ratios of GDP per capita in US dollars with GDP of the
same state in the selected reference year. The interactive plot gives
you an opportunity to choose states, reference year and the time
interval of series. You will see how these plots reveal the most general
regional and geopolitical features of economic convergence. You will
observe the incredible coincidence of GDP series for some selected
states. From our point of view, this is a challenge for macroeconomics
theory as observed universality has to be explained. It means that the
external economic environment and stage of states development maters
more than specific regulation inside the state. Three Baltic states:
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia serve as a good example of such
universality, despite considerable differences in their regulation
within states. Similar comparison is appropriate for the Visegrad Group:
Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak and Hungary. The Joint graphic of all
these 7 states is given in Figure or you can open the interactive graph
in the new Tab clicking on [Baltic and Visegrad
GDP](#attachment_2437).
It is worth to note that the relative growth rate of Baltic states is
considerably higher than growth of Visegrad Group in the period 1995 -
2011. This exhibits a more rapid convergence of Baltic states into
European economic space.

We do consider the universal behavior of new EU economies as a
challenging macroeconomic phenomenon, which deserve a scientific
reasoning and quantitative description. Comprehensive macroeconomic
description of this phenomenon should contribute to the explanation of
economic convergence. From our point of view, the main concepts of such
consideration could be based on the methods of statistical physics,
[Levelling of prices through the real appreciation of currencies of
developing
states](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/realex.htm "Real exchange rate"),
[Balassa-Samuelson
effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balassa%E2%80%93Samuelson_effect "Balassa-Samuelson effect")
and other models of international trade and investment.
