Previously
we wrote about [randomly generated
attractors](/randomly-generated-strange-attractors "Randomly generated strange attractors").
That time we have used Wolfram CDF technology to power the interactive
applet. This technology has a serious drawback that you have to have
installed specific additional software to be able to use it. As of now
we have replaced the old app with HTML5-based interactive applet. This
applet can be run on almost any modern web browser without a need to
have any additional software preinstalled.

The new applet can be found in the old
[post](/randomly-generated-strange-attractors#html5-app "Randomly generated strange attractors")
and
[here](/uploads/models/random-attractor/index.html).
