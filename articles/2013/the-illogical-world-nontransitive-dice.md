[Previously]({filename}/articles/2013/the-illogical-world-voting-paradox.md)
we wrote about the "illogical" world, which is full of paradoxes and
nontransitivity. This time we discuss an elementary dice game, which is
also nontransitive and thus appears to be unnatural, "cheated" and etc.
Yet the example is completely natural and easily understandable, it can
be also tested empirically (and not only theoretically as the previous
example) - it can be played at home! All of the relevant information
you'll hear in the youtube video (see below).

We also provide a more simple take on the same topic
below.

**Transitivity** is natural and expected property. It is how the most of
the times "it should be". For example, it is clearly understandable that
if 10 is larger than 7 and 7 is larger than 5, then 10 is also larger
than 5. The properties are "inherited" in a transparent fashion. Yet
life itself is not that simple and transparent. Previously we have
already given example on the preference chain, which can indeed become a
cycle. This purely theoretical example can also be experience
empirically by making the dice as they are show in the
[figure](#attachment_2490) (note that the walls, which are not seen,
mirror values shown on the walls, which are seen). Which of the dice is
a better one? Which one will roll higher values than the other two?

The answer should be evident - the red one will beat the green one with
the probability of 5/9, the green one will be better than blue one with
the probability of 5/9. Now, naturally one would expect that the red die
should be better than the blue die, but it is not so. The blue die wins
against red one with the probability of 5/9! How that can be? Note the
values on the dice!

Applet
------

Would you like to try to defeat opponent who always selects the superior
die? Go ahead and try! Note that after playing many games your opponent
gains upper hand.
