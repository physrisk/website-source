In the XVIII century Nicolas de Condorcet,
French mathematician and philosopher, described an interesting
situation, which is most widely known as the voting paradox. This
situation is a perfect example of how the otherwise logical human
behavior, on the individual level, can be easily destroyed by collective
behavior, on the global level. We would naturally assume that the
micro-level logic would rise bottom-up, yet it doesn't and that is a
paradox!

Let us imagine that we have three persons who choose among three
options. They are asked not choose a single of the available option, but
they are asked to rank them according to their preference. Our aim is to
understand the collective priorities of these three persons. For the
sake of the simplicity let us assume that people have to choose between
- apples, pear and cherry. The choice for each individual person should
not be that hard and we would end up with three priority lists.

Now let us make assumptions about to of the lists. So, the first person
likes apples more than bananas, while the cherries are in the third
place. The second person is a cherry lover, while he likes apples and
bananas less. After these two votes it is evident that apples are more
likeable (3 of 4 cases), cherries are in the second place (2 of 4) and
bananas are last (1 of 4). But let us not forget that we have a third
person, who can ruin this perfect order. Indeed if he likes bananas over
cherries over apples, then the priorities become mixed and illogical.
From the [voting table](#attachment_2488), it should be evident that
apples (A) are liked more than bananas (B), while bananas are liked more
than cherries (C), but the cherries are more liked than apples. The
priority ordering becomes non-transitive:

\begin{equation}
 A &gt; B &gt; C &gt;A . 
\end{equation}

Thus we have seen that people on the individual level had clear
understanding of what the like the most, yet on the global level the
community has no understanding of its preference. This situation is
known as the voting paradox.
