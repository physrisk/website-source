Belousov-Zhabotinsky
reaction \[cite id="Zhabotinsky2007"\] is a chemical reaction, or more
precisely a reaction family, known for exhibiting temporal and spatial
oscillations.

This reaction is one of the classical examples of the natural non-linear
oscillations. Another prominent example is the previously analyzed
prey-predator interactions in the ecosystem. Interestingly enough
despite being of a very different nature both of these example can be
modeled using [Lotka-Volterra
equations](/lotka-volterra-equations "Lotka-Volterra equations").

In this text we will also consider certai cellular automaton, which
replicates the spatial oscillations seen in some of the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions.<!--more-->

Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction and Lotka-Volterra equations
----------------------------------------------------------

In the most simplest and general case Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction can
be described by the following chain of chemical reactions:


\begin{equation}
 A\_1 + X\_1 \rightarrow 2 X\_1 + A\_2, 
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
 X\_1 + X\_2 \rightarrow 2 X\_2 + A\_3, 
\end{equation}



\begin{equation}
 X\_2 \rightarrow A\_4 , 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  X\_i \\\) are the main chemical ingredients, while \\\( A\_i \\\) are secondary chemical ingredients (which are needed for
reactions to occur, or which are the product of these reactions).

From the above should be evident that \\\(  X\_1 \\\) concentration
increases proportionally to \\\(  k\_1 C\_{a1} C\_{x1} \\\) (the first
reaction in the chain) and decreases proportionally to \\\(  k\_2C\_{x1} C\_{x2} \\\) (the second reaction in the chain). Mathematically
this can be written as ordinary differential equation:


\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} C\_{x1} = \left\[ k\_1 C\_{a1} C\_{x1} - k\_2C\_{x1} C\_{x2} \right\] \mathrm{d} t. 
\end{equation}


Here we use \\\(  C\_i \\\) for concentrations, where \\\(  i \\\) is the
index of ingredient (ex., "x1" stands for \\\(  X\_1 \\\)). The rates of
reaction is denoted as \\\(  k\_i \\\), where \\\(  i \\\) is a number of
reaction in the chain.

The second reaction increases \\\(  X\_2 \\\) concentration
proportionally to \\\(  k\_2 C\_{x1} C\_{x2} \\\). The concentration of
\\\(  X\_2 \\\) decreases due to the third reaction and proportionally to
\\\(  k\_3 C\_{x2} \\\). Mathematically this can be expressed as:


\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} C\_{x2} = \left\[ k\_2 C\_{x1} C\_{x2} - k\_3C\_{x2} \right\] \mathrm{d} t. 
\end{equation}


Now compare these two ordinary differential equation and [Lotka-Volterra
equations](/lotka-volterra-equations "Lotka-Volterra equations")!
The \\\(  C\_{a1} \\\) can be assumed to be a constant model parameter
for the sake of comparison.

Cellular automaton
------------------

The cellular automaton model for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction was
proposed by A. K. Dewdney in \[cite id="Dewdney1988SciAm"\]. The rules
were set as follows:

-   If the cell is in state 1, then it changes its state to the \\\(     \[a / k\_1\]+\[ b / k\_2 \]+1 \\\) state, where \\\(  a \\\) is a number
    of cells in the intermediate states (namely larger than 1 and
    smaller than 255), while \\\(  b \\\) is a number of cells in the 255
    state. \\\(  k\_1 \\\) and \\\(  k\_2 \\\) are the model parameters,
    which should be in the range from 1 to 8. The square brackets
    extracts integer from a real number (t.y. \\\(  \[2.5\]=2 \\\)).
-   If the cell is in state 255, then it changes its state to 1.
-   The cells in the intermediate states (namely larger than 1 and
    smaller than 255), switch to \\\(  \[ S / (a+b+1) \]+g \\\), where
    \\\(  a \\\) and \\\(  b \\\) are the same as before, while \\\(     S \\\) are the sum of the states of the nearest 8 neighbors. \\\(     g \\\) is a parameter set by user, it should be integer number larger
    than 1, but smaller than 255.

These rules should be applied synchronously to all cells in the grid.

Note that not all parameter sets provide "good" results (the ones
reminiscent to the those seen in youtube video). Also note that the grid
is toroid.
