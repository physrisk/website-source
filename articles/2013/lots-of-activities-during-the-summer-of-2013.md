The summer of 2013 will be a very
interesting one for us. In June we will participate in four conferences,
in Lithuania and abroad, and present five reports (4 talks and 1 poster)
on the most recent research done by us. During July and August we will
have two students-trainees, who will participate in the project
"[Promotion of Student Scientific
Activities](http://studentai.lmt.lt/index_en.php)" from the [Research
Council of Lithuania](http://www.lmt.lt/en/). The training will be held
on the topics of "Economic convergence as thermodynamic appreciation of
real currency exchange rate" (supervisor dr. (HP) Vygintas Gontis;
student-trainee Kęstutis Acus) and "Controling complex stochastic
systems" (supervisor Aleksejus Kononovicius; student-trainee Ignas
Kazakevičius).<!--more-->

**On
the 5-6th of June** in the Mykolas Romeris University the international
conference "[Social Transformations in Contemporary Society
2013](http://sticsconference.blogspot.com/)" will be held. During the
conference Aleksejus Kononovicius will give a talk on "Agent-based and
macroscopic modeling of the complex socio-economic systems" (coauthor
Valentas Daniūnas). The material behind the presentation will be
published in an open-access journal "[Social
Technologies](http://st.mruni.eu/)".

**On
the 10-12th of June** in the Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University, the
"[40th Lithuanian national physics
conference](http://www.lnfk.ff.vu.lt/)" will be held. During this
conference we will present an oral presentation ("Mikroskopinis ir
makroskopinis sudėtingų sistemų modeliavimas" by Aleksejus Kononovicius
and Vygintas Gontis) and also a poster presentation ("Levio triukšmo
veikiamų netiesinių sistemų savybių tyrimas" by Rytis Kazakevičius,
Julius Ruseckas and Bronislovas Kaulakys). All of the presentations will

Agents](https://sites.google.com/site/wehia2013/)" will be held.
Aleksejus Kononovicius will be participating in both. During the
conference he will give a talk on "Generalizing binary choice
agent-based herding model" (coauthor Vygintas Gontis).

**On
the 24-28th of June** in Montpelier, France, "[22th International
Conference on Noise and Fluctuations](http://icnf.wordpress.com/)" will
be held. During the conference Vygintas Gontis will be giving an oral
presentation "Fluctuation analysis of three agent group herding model"
(coauthor Aleksejus Kononovicius). The related article should be also
published in the conference proceedings.
