The summer of 2013 will be a very
interesting one for us. In June we will participate in four conferences,
in Lithuania and abroad, and present five reports (4 talks and 1 poster)
on the most recent research done by us. During July and August we will
have two students-trainees, who will participate in the project
"Promotion of Student Scientific
Activities" from the [Research
Council of Lithuania](https://lmt.lrv.lt/en/). The training will be held
on the topics of "Economic convergence as thermodynamic appreciation of
real currency exchange rate" (supervisor dr. (HP) Vygintas Gontis;
student-trainee Kęstutis Acus) and "Controling complex stochastic
systems" (supervisor Aleksejus Kononovicius; student-trainee Ignas
Kazakevičius).
