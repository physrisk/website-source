What physics has to do with the analysis of social systems? Well, society is
a complex system after all, so we can approach it as we would any complex
system. Though, as usual, domain knowledge is often useful in such
approaches.

We invite you to watch this interesting video scripted and edited by J.
Llabres and Sara Oliver from [IFISC](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/).
