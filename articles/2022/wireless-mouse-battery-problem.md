When teaching Numerical Methods and [Matlab](/tag/matlab/) I like to
challenge myself and take upon doing some new practical project to show my
students how to apply their newly acquired skills to do something fun. This
video is from the 2020 spring semester and in it I explore service time of a
wireless mouse with two batteries.

For detailed problem statement and the solution see the recording on Youtube.
Though, notably, the sound quality of the recording was not good. You
can also find more details on GitHub, too (check out
