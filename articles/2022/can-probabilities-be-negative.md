Can probabilities be negative? Yes, whenever information behaves in quirky
ways in [quantum systems](/tag/quantum-mechanics/). Video comments seem to
suggest that similar observations can also apply in [traffic](/tag/traffic).

For a detailed explanation on when using negative probabilities might make
