So, the summer has ended and a new academic year has started. This summer I
finally was able to get almost three weeks of decent vacation time (even did
some unsuccessful fishing and stargazing). Thus I have recovered enough
energy to prepare some new content for Physics of Risk. So Physics of Risk
lives again!

Now, this semester we will take a look at a quite a few [statistical
puzzles](/tag/statistics/). Some of the upcoming posts will be inspired by
recent preprints I have seen on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) this summer,
while others will be solutions to various Riddler problems published on
[fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com).

I was also considering writing a couple of posts on point processes (related
to my newest paper [cite id="Kononovicius2022CSF"]), random telegraph noise
(currently still working on this paper) and non-Markovian opinion dynamics
(seen couple of interesting seminars this summer). Though these will likely
have to wait until after the new year.

Happy new academic year!
