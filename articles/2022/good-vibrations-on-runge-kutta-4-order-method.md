In the [last post]({filename}/articles/2022/runge-kutta-4-order-method.md)
we have provided you with interactive app, which allows you to compare Euler
method and Runge-Kutta 4th order method. Now we share a video by [Good
Vibrations](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_zn0wBLlOpIlQWY3V_Y3gw), which
discusses the exact derivation of the Runge-Kutta methods.
