[A year ago]({filename}/articles/2021/solving-monopoly.md) I have shared
recording of my lecture in which I have used [Matlab](/tag/matlab/) and
[Markov chains](/tag/markov-chains/) to solve [board game](/tag/board-games)
Monopoly. The solution revolved around finding properties, which were
visited most often.

The following youtube video discusses a different approach based on [machine
learning](/tag/machine-learning/).
