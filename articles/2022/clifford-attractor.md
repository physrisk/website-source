Typically due to friction (or other dissipative forces) physical systems
reach stationary states, even if it takes really long time. Nonlinear
systems, on the other hand, sometimes exhibit strange and erratic
behavior.

## Clifford attractor

Clifford attractor is generated by iterating following set of iterative
equations:

\begin{equation}
    x\_{i+1} = \sin\left(f\_1 y\_i\right) + A\_1 \cos\left(f\_1 x\_i\right) ,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    y\_{i+1} = \sin\left(f\_2 x\_i\right) + A\_2 \cos\left(f\_2 y\_i\right) .
\end{equation}

Where \\\( f\_1 \\\), \\\( A\_1 \\\), \\\( f\_2 \\\) and \\\( A\_2 \\\) are
parameters, whose values determine the shape of the attractor (the figure
you generate).

We have already explored another set of iterative equations, those were
based on quadratic polynomials, few years back (see [the old
post]({filename}/articles/2013/randomly-generated-strange-attractors.md)).
As this set of iterative equations are based on \\\( \sin \\\) and
\\\( \cos \\\) functions, expect to see more of attractors have circular or
spherical appearance.

## Gallery

Here are few interesting shapes I was able to find either online or using
the search function of the app below.

The shades of gray you are seeing in these figures correspond to the number
of the attractor trajectories passing each pixel.

## Interactive app

This interactive app will help you generate Clifford attractors. You can
either select your own parameter values or generate them randomly (by
pressing randomize).

Not all attractors you'll find will be interesting. If after a quick moment
the plot goes red, this means that you have found a quite boring attractor.
Under such circumstances the generation will be automatically stopped.

In some cases attractors will not occupy whole area of the plot, as the
naive estimation of bounds will not always be correct. In this case
you should press "Resize" button, which will select new plot limits based on
the recently generated points. This should give more optimal limits.

If you are unlucky in your search for another nice random Clifford
attractor, then you can automate the search by pressing "Search" button. In
this case the app will try different random parameter values until an
interesting attractor is found. To stop the search simply click either "Stop
search" button or "Stop" button.

In my experience interesting Clifford attractors are easier to find than
quadratic polynomial attractors we have looked at
[earlier]({filename}/articles/2013/randomly-generated-strange-attractors.md).
For Clifford attractors slight modifications of the parameter values should
not completely destroy the shape of the attractor. So you can play with
parameter values to perfect the shape you are looking at.
