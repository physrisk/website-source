Summary statistics, whether mean, standard deviation or any other single
number, are useful, but sometimes they can mislead - vastly different data
sets can have similar or even identical summary statistics. In the video
below [Robert
Kosara](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKecjwo5N9YrRyYf_sj72KQ) discusses
this phenomenon in more detail.

Thus here we give you an opposite advice to the one we gave
[previously]({filename}/articles/2022/ks-test.md). You should plot the data
to see whether summary statistic you have obtained make sense.

Well, you should actually always do both things - visualize the data and do
some tests or summarization. If intuition from the visuals and the numbers
differs, then you should look for things that may have gone wrong.
