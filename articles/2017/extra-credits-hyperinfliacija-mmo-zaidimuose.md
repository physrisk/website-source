In
computer games players control characters and earn money by doing quests
and killing monsters. They spend these money for upgrades and other neat
stuff (such as own house, animal and etc.). But this mechanic has
inherent problem - earned money are created literally from nothing. The
money, which goblin chieftain had, were never used in games economy.
They are just a reward for player. The same, though less obviously,
story is with NPC - they give the same task they were programmed to give
and the reward is also preset. Game economics has nothing to do with
reward given. If player is just one, then there is no problem, but if
you, as a game designer, have thousands of players... you will soon have
to face a problem of hyperinflation. More on what it is and how game
designers combat it in the following Extra Credits video.
