It is well known that "there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."
Yet if and only if the speaker and the audience are not careful enough to make a blunder.
Previously we have already linked a video about [the most well known and counter-intuitive
Bayes theorem]({filename}/articles/2017/veritasium-bayesian-trap.md)
and now we share another video discussing another well known statistics paradox.

As described in One Minute Physics video below, Simpson's paradox occurs when you have data
set, which contains multiple groups. When analyzing groups separately one trend could be
observed (the more you earn the less happy you become), while after combining the groups the
trend disappears or is reversed.
