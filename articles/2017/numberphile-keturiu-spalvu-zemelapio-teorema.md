Did
you notice that maps use just but a few colors, while we have more than
200 countries here on Earth. Obviously it would not be rational to use
different color per each different country. It is more convenient for
our human vision, then there is as few colors as possible as then we can
pick contrasting colors. Wouldn't it be interesting to know if there is
some minimal number of differing colors necessary to create colored
maps? More about this in this Numberphile video.
