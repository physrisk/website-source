In
2014 Australian programmer started "social experiment" - he allowed
thousands of viewers on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv) to play computer
game. Thousands of people could write into common chat to decide what
the player controlled character in [Pokemon
Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red) will do - will he
move up or down? Will he fish in the fond or ride a bicycle? What
pokemon would he catch? Having in mind online troll culture, one could
not have expected much, but in 16 days the game was completed.

Recently one programmer working at Amazon entrusted Twitch viewers with
his lifetime savings of 50 thousand US dollars. This project already
runs for about two weeks and so far the internet did not waste his
savings...

This curiosity could be viewed on [StockStream Twitch
channel](https://www.twitch.tv/stockstream). But you can not only watch,
but also influence the trades that will be executed. This can be done
during session hours of New York Stock Exchange (workdays from 15:30 to
22:00 in Lithuanian time).
