Currently I am waiting for the Research Council of Lithuanian
post-doctoral project final results.
Though interim results are already known, but RCL still needs to
decide where they will cut. This situation starts up my existensial
thinking on what is good science and what is not. I believe that
at least partialy it is well covered by the following Numberphile
video.

In this video Cliff Stoll presents one of the homeworks he gave
his students to test their ability to notice subtleties and if
they are self-conscious (able to check their own errors) enough.
This qualities are somewhat important to produce a good piece of
scientific work.
