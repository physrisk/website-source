At the heart of economics
lies two fundamental concepts, to which most of the other concepts are
related. These two concepts are supply and demand. From every day life
we are rather familiar with these two concepts - we demand goods and
services, while industry supplies them. While industry demands labor and
we supply it. But this familiarity to most of us is rather superficial,
thus in this text we will try to provide a simple academical
introduction into these concepts and their role in economics.

It is intended that this text will serve as an introduction into a
[series of posts](/tag/price-formation-series/) on how and why free market does (not) work.<!--more-->

Let us start by discussing **the law of demand**. This law of economics
states that the pricier the product is (all other things being equal)
the less people will be willing to buy it. This seems rather reasonable,
because if the only difference is price, then it would be rational to
choose cheaper product. In the figure below we have shown a linear
demand curve, from the graph it can be easily inferred that the priciest
product is the least demanded, while the cheapest is the most demanded.
In general the demand curve could be any non-increasing function, e.g.,
\\\(  P \propto 1/Q \\\).

Evidently **the law of supply** is of the opposite form. This law of
economics states that the more people are willing to pay for the
product, the larger quantity of the product will be produced (as the
producer will try to maximize his gains). In the figure below we have
shown a linear supply curve, from the graph it is easy to infer that the
larger the price paid for the product, the more of it will be produced.
In general the supply curve could by any non-decreasing curve, e.g,
\\\(  Q \propto \sqrt{P} \\\).

Note that in both figures pairs of \\\(  Q \\\) and \\\(  P \\\) represent
points on the respective curves. If point \\\(  (P\_i,Q\_i) \\\) is not
on the curve, then either production or consumption is sub-optimal.

Here, while looking for optimal pair of \\\(  (P\_i,Q\_i) \\\) the
dynamics emerge. But at first one needs to combine two laws into one
model. Because then providing supply one must to take demand into
account, if some producer decides to produce 100 units of certain
product, there might not be enough people willing to buy it for the set
price. The belief in these dynamics is the basis for the free market
ideology, which claims that markets will eventually find "optimal" price
without any interference from the outside.

We will discuss the dynamics next time. This time let us finish with an
obvious reveal - the optimal point is where both supply and demand
curves intersect. As this point is the only point at which both sides
are satisfied.

**Note (written on 2017-12-19):** After revisiting the topic I have noticed a rather obvious
thing - why the laws are stated as curves? They should be stated as
areas. Because you would buy the item if it costs as much as you imagine
it is worth or cheaper (a point below the demand curve). Also you would
be willing to sell item at some reasonable price or at larger price (a point
above the supply curve). In case of supply law a reasonable explanation
is competition - you can not raise price too much as your competitors
would have chance to steal your customers.
