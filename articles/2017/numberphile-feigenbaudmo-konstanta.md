Last time when we
wrote about [Lotka-Volterra
equations]({filename}/articles/2012/lotka-volterra-equations.md), we
have mentioned Verhulst's model of population dynamics, given by

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} x = r x ( 1 – x ) \mathrm{d} t, 
\end{equation}

which describes temporal evolution of ecological systems with limited
supply of food. The model has parameter \\\(  r \\\) which controls the
availability of food to the population. It would be natural to ask how
the availability of food impacts the dynamics of model? Does the
population converge? If so, then to which state? May be the population
does not converge? How do the answers to these questions change based on
model parameter? More on this and the interesting mathematics in this
Numberphile video.
