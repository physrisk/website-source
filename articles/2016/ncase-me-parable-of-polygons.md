Continuing from the recent text on [Schelling
model]({filename}/articles/2015/schellings-segregation-model.md) we
would like to recommend reading text by Vi Hart and Nicky Case called
["Parable of the polygons"](https://ncase.me/polygons/). It is written in
rather playful manner, though it also manages to touch sensitive social
and political topics. The text also contains couple of neatly looking
interactive demonstrations.
