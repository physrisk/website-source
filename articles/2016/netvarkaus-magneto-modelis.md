Previously on Physics of Risk we
have already discussed the [Ising
model](/ising-model), which is one of the most
fundamental models in statistical physics. We are especially interested
in [Isingo model](/ising-model) as it is
frequently applied to model social systems. One of such examples is the
[Bornholdt model](/bornholdt-model) of the
financial markets.

This time we will consider a modification of [Ising
model](/ising-model), which describes
disordered magnet (a so-called spin glass). In this text we will briefly
cover the essential feature of spin glasses as well as provide
interactive HTML5 applet of the spin glasses.<!--more-->

What is a disordered magnet?
----------------------------

Let us remind you that in normal magnets, magnetic moments of
interacting particles align in one particular fashion. The interactions
are either ferromagnetic (the spins align in the same direction) or
anti-ferromagnetic (the spins align in the opposite directions). In
disordered magnet we may have different types and strengths of
interactions at the same time.

In low temperature, in absence of thermal noise, normal magnets reach
ordered state. While disordered magnets quickly freeze in the disordered
state.

The simplest spin glass model may be obtained by assuming that \\\( J \\\) of the original [Ising
model](/ising-model) are normally
distributed random variables. Note that set of \\\(  J \\\) should be
pregenerated prior to the modelling it self and should not be changed
during the modelling.

HTML5 applet
------------

In the applet below we present the implementation of the modified
[Ising model](/ising-model) on 50Ã—50 2D
square lattice. In the applet window you can see four figures - current
spatial spin distribution graph, evolution of energy, entropy and
magnetization. Single iteration corresponds to the one thousand attempts
to change the spin of the random particle. After every iteration each
figure is renewed. Numerical calculations are started by pressing button
"Start" and can be stopped by pressing button "Stop". After stopping the
calculations user can resume them or restart them from the beginning.

This applet is a slightly modified version of previous applet, which was
available on the original page about [Ising
model](/ising-model). Thus you can also see
options relevant for the original [Ising
model](/ising-model) - namely you can enable
ferromagnetic ("J=1") interactions or anti-ferromagnetic ("J=-1")
interactions. Note that critical temperature of the original [Ising
model](/ising-model) in this applet was
around \\\(  \frac{\Delta E}{k T} = 0.4 \\\) (you may want to use this
value with other "J=..." options).
