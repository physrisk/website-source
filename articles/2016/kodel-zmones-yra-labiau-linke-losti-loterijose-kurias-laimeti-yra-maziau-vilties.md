In
the begging of 2016 largest US lottery
[Powerball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerball) decreased the odds
of winning the jackpot to around 1 in 300 million. What is interesting
in this development is that it was done to attract more players and thus
increase the profitability of the lottery. Intuition would suggest that
any rational individual should quit playing the lottery, but what will
real people do?

The main catch in these lotteries is that the jackpot is carried over to
the next game until it is won by somebody. Thus smaller odds of winning
the jackpot imply that the jackpot will have more time to "grow". Namely
there will be more consecutive games with jackpot left intact, thus the
jackpots will become larger. The data shows that the larger the jackpot
the more people will buy lottery tickets. Thus in the long run this
strategy should attract more people to play the lottery. Consequently,
in the long run, the profitability of the lottery should increase.
