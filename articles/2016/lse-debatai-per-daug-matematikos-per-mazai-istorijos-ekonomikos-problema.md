Recently one of the most prestigious
schools of economics, London School of Economics, held an interesting
debate between economists who prefer historical retrospective and
economists who prefer mathematical modelling. Interestingly enough both
sides of the debate agreed that neoclassical economic theory doesn't
work well. But the answer why and its implications differ. Bellow you
should see a youtube video with the recording of the debate. We invite
you to listen.

<!--more-->The discussion might be summarized as follows. "Historians"
are highly convinced that neoclassical economic theory has failed due to
its intimate relationship with math and lack of historical insights.
Neoclassical economists obtain nice mathematical equations, but fail to
learn from the repeated financial crises. "Historians" suggest that
there should be less math in economics and that the math should be
replaced with historical analysis. As the debate goes on this rather
radical suggestion grows milder and is developed into a rather
reasonable proposal, but its essence remains the same.

"Mathematicians" on the other hand subtly pointed out that "historians"
fail to see what mathematics truly is and why it is actually used.
"Mathematicians" agreed with the "historians" that maths for sake of
pure maths (as "historians" imagine applications of mathematics in
economics) is not (or should not be) of interest to economists. Yet
maths and computer modeling is an excellent tool to test general
insights about how economic systems work. The data may be interpreted
wildly differently and it is completely unclear which of the
interpretations is correct one. Maths, and computer modelling, helps
narrow down the set of possible interpretations. It is like filter, or
more like reality check.

I believe that the outcome of debate was somewhat "rigged" (see the
title of the debate). One side has demonstrated significantly more
understanding of the other side's position, while the other side
stubbornly defending their beliefs. It wouldn't be too much of a
problem, if not for the mistakes of formal logic (especially [Straw
man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)), which significantly
weakened the grounding of claims by a certain side.

To conclude, it is evident that we do support "mathematicians" in this
case. Though insights gained from pure observations should not be
forgotten as well.
