Anholt worked a long time as an independent policy advisor. He has
helped politicians and policy makers to improve economic, political and
cultural relationships with other countries Now he works on interesting
project - so-called Good Country Index. This index attempts to quantify
how good the countries are in a sense that how useful they are to the
world. See Simon's Anholt's talk recorded for TED.
