We previously delved into the [statistical
physics](/tag/statistical-physics/) of [birds on a
wire]({filename}/articles/2022/birds-on-wire.md), where the avian subjects,
though sober, exhibited remarkably short tempers. Now, consider the
following: which journey is more likely to be completed, that of a drunkard
finding their way home or a tipsy bird navigating its flight path homeward?
It's an intriguing question posed by
[Mathemaniac](https://www.youtube.com/@mathemaniac) in a
video that explores the theoretical disparities between [Brownian
motion](/tag/brownian-motion/) in 2D and 3D realms, all without any harm to
our feathered or human friends.
