We invite you to watch and think about the role of prediction in science.
While the media and funding bodies tend to prefer when the research projects
have practical applications (which often require making some new
predictions), this is not how the most well-known theories were formulated.
Many of the famous theories in Physics (and other sciences) were iterations
of the earlier "clunkier" theories. This is discussed in the following video
by the [Last Theory](https://www.youtube.com/@lasttheory) YouTube channel.

Note that this channel is linked to [Stephen
Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram), who by some is
regarded as a highly controversial figure in science. Although, he is the
mastermind behind the [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)
computer algebra system, which we like a lot (at least to help me with
analytical derivations).
