This summer I had couple of experiences which ruined my opinion of [open
access](/tag/open-access/). More than ten years ago I have felt that
openness is crucial for future fundamental developments, but now I clearly
see perverse practices even in top journals and publishers.

## SciPost experience

As an author, my paper [cite id="Kononovicius2024upoiss"] got rejected from
SciPost. The funny thing was that reviewing took unreasonably long time
(more than eight months), yet still was of a rather poor quality (despite
SciPost being high impact and otherwise well regarded journal). I blame most
of the delays on the editor (it took months for them to respond to some of
my inquiries), while in their emails editor has blamed me for suggesting
uncooperative reviewers. I am glad to help whenever I can, and I try to be
fair when suggesting reviewers, but picking reviewers is not the authors'
job, is it?

First round of reviews was reasonable. While the second round was quite an
absurd experience. It contained a single review, which is uncommon in
comparison to other higher tier journals. Furthermore, that single review
was written in less than 15 minutes (based on the timeline visible in the
SciPost editorial system). As a reviewer, it usually takes me at least
couple of hours to read a manuscript before making my mind up, and starting
to write a review. So, I guess it should be no surprise that review written
in 15 minutes was a complete nonsense. At the time of receiving this review,
I have decided against responding immediately and instead decided to wait
for a second review. Yet, it never came. Instead, in few weeks time have
received an email that my time for response was up (I was never notified
to respond as soon as possible), and that the editor decided to reject
the paper.

Yet the funniest thing of all is that SciPost supposedly emphasizes
openness, but it extends only to accepted papers. So my terrible experience
is conveniently swept under the rug. Only from the entries in arXiv it is
visible that I tried and failed to publish in "prestigious" SciPost journal.
The submission history is now only visible to me and the editors of SciPost.
Though I can access only the history of the revised, not the original,
submission. In my humble opinion things openness is useful only when it is
not selective (obviously, within reasonable bounds), otherwise it is just a
distraction.

**So, SciPost = bad?** I do not know. I have talked to couple of my colleagues
about this experience. Some of them were shocked, as they had excellent
experience with SciPost. While others had similarly terrible experience with
SciPost.

## MDPI experience

On the other hand, I had terrible experience as a reviewer at MDPI. In June
I got a couple invitations to review papers, which seemingly fall within my
expertise. The problem with econophysics and sociophysics, is that everyone
thinks that social sciences are easy. But they are not, nor econophysics or
sociophysics are social sciences. Hence, there are lots of low quality
submissions and even accepted papers.

Those five papers I got to review in June were quite terrible. Some of them
were ridiculously poorly written. Others presented poorly designed or
conceptually wrong research. Some were terrible from both perspectives. So,
I have written five quick negative reviews, outlining the major issues and
providing quick overview of minor issues. Obviously, I have suggested
rejecting all of them.

Funny thing is that I have received three or four of them for the second
round of review. All of them are now published no matter what I did in the
second round of reviews. I have written new negative reviews, I also tried
reasoning with the editors, I have tried pointing out trivial mathematical
mistakes as a sign that authors do not understand their own materials. It
seems that all my comments were ignored.

Furthermore, I was notified about the papers being published despite ticking
the box that I do not want to be informed about their status. Also in some
instances I have directly told the editor that I am not interested in the
manuscripts.

**So, MDPI = bad?** I can't say for sure. Yet I intend to limit my reviewing
activity for MDPI. Namely, if the requested review is not for a special
issue headed by someone I know and respect, or if the manuscript in question
is not immediately relevant to me, I will not agree to review.

## What I learned from this

I guess my main take away from these experiences with [open
access](/tag/open-access/) publishing is that it has slowly become
perverted. It was a great initiative, but paying for publishing articles
creates perverse incentives for publishers (publish more, earn more) and
scientists (pay money, get your nonsense published, keep your position).
SciPost tried to address this by not taking money for publishing, but their
supposedly high standards stink of "scientific feudalism" (high impact
scientists propelling their "underlings" towards success) and "cult of the
hot".
