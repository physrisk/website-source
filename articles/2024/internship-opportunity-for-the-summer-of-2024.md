[Research Council of Lithuania](https://lmt.lrv.lt/en/) currently accepts
student applications to do internship projects this summer at various
institutions across Lithuania. One of the projects students could apply for
is mine!

My project is called "Influence of the state interaction network on the
statistical properties of the voter model". I would expect for the intern to
take a look at the [multi-state noisy voter
model]({filename}/articles/2019/many-state-herd-model-and-its-application-to-lithuanian-parliamentary-elections.md),
and explore what happens when some of transitions between the states are
forbidden (something similar was explored in [AB
model]({filename}/articles/2017/ab-model.md)). You do not need to be
familiar with sociophysics or [opinion dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics/),
though I would expect the project to have a significant numerical aspect to
it (some programming skills will be required).

Interns will get 1000 Eur monthly stipend. Plus, for students coming from
other countries or cities to Vilnius there is possibility to get support for
accommodation. Based on this call's rules I will have to give priority to
students outside Vilnius University. More details about this call is
available on RCL's website:
