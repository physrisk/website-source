Another summer has gone by. This year my main summer activity was
supervising [summer internship
project]({filename}/articles/2024/internship-opportunity-for-the-summer-of-2024.md).
The intern was rather capable, so the project itself was not very eventful
and comparably effortless on my part. Also the final conclusion on the
research hypothesis was negative (i.e., state interaction network doesn't
seem to have any effect on stationary distribution), so there wasn't much to
analyze.

From a technical side, [once
again]({filename}/articles/2023/it-is-september-again-2023.md), my
institution's IT admins have irritated my a bit. In mid-June I have received
a notification about outdated software on a server I supervise (which is not
related to Physics of Risk in any way). I promptly connected to the server
to immediately apply the update (as I was warned about severe security risks
of not updating), just to find that no update is available for the Linux
server. After quick search I have found that a newer version of the software
in question is in fact directly available from its developers, but hasn't
yet landed in the official repositories. It is not a good idea to update
from outside the official repositories, so I felt somewhat annoyed due to
being prodded and lectured for no real reason.

Summer experiences aside, what is coming for Physics of Risk? At the time of
writing I do not know. I do have material for a rant about my summer
experiences with [open access](/tag/open-access/) publishing, but really not
much else. I expect that the first-party content might become much rarer in
the foreseeable future.
