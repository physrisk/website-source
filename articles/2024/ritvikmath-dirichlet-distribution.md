[ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath) has already [explained to
us what the Beta distribution
is]({filename}/articles/2023/ritvikmath-beta-distribution.md). There is
another video by [ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath), which
explains multidimensional generalization of it. This generalization is known
as [Dirichlet
distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution). Watch
it for the data science perspective.

I myself understand Dirichlet distribution from the perspective of [noisy
voter model](/tag/voter-model/) (or [Kirman's model](/tag/kirman-model/).
Although I haven't explicitly mentioned it earlier, Dirichlet distribution
arises from the [multistate generalization of the voter
model]({filename}/articles/2019/many-state-herd-model-and-its-application-to-lithuanian-parliamentary-elections.md).
