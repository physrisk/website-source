Like in the [previous
year]({filename}/articles/2023/abm-tutorial-in-lithuanian.md), I gave
another two lecture introduction to the [agent-based
modeling](/tag/agent-based-models/) in socio- and econophysics. This time
in English! Otherwise the changes to the slides and material itself are
mostly visual in comparison to the last year slides.
