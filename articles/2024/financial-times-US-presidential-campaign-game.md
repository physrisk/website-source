Presidential elections in the United States are quickly approaching. For
this special occasion [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com) has created an
interactive game, which allows you to become party leader and try to win
electoral college in 10 swing states. You will compete against other readers
of the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com). At my best attempt I have beaten
75% of the other readers. How many will you beat?

The game itself is inspired by [game theory](/tag/game-theory/) and uses
[Colonel Blotto game](/tag/colonel-blotto-game/) as its basis.
