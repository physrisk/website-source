Recently we have been looking a lot into [Poisson
process](/tag/poisson-process) and other related more physical topics. But
the things we have been talking about also applies to our earlier more
social science related works. This video by
[Mathemaniac](https://www.youtube.com/c/Mathemaniac) discusses how the
statistical methodology behind the [Poisson process](/tag/poisson-process/)
can be used to understand queues. As usual, we invite you to watch this
fascinating video!
