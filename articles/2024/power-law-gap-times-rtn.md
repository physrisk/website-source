In the [last
post]({filename}/articles/2024/superposition-of-lorentzians-with-fixed-height.md)
we have assumed that the event rate of the individual processes making up
the superposition needs to be distributed according the bounded Pareto
distribution. And we have seen that in \\\( \alpha = 0 \\\) case,
[1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/) will be obtained. But superposition of such processes
seems to be very demanding assumption, maybe we can choose another
assumption? Here we will see what happens if we assume that gap times are
assumed to follow bounded Pareto distribution, while the pulse times will
still follow exponential distribution.

## What if the gaps are power-law distributed?

Recall that here we consider a signal, which is composed of non-overlapping
rectangular pulses (see [Fig. 1](#snorp-fig)). Thus it is full described by
a sequence of gap (detrapping) times, \\\( \tau\_i \\\), and pulse
(trapping) times, \\\( \theta\_i \\\).

In an [earlier
post]({filename}/articles/2023/noise-generated-by-single-charge-carrier.md)
we have assumed that both \\\( \tau\_i \\\) and \\\( \theta\_i \\\) are
sample from the same exponential distribution and have obtained
[Lorentzian](/tag/lorentzian/) spectral density.
But let us now use the general result from [cite id="Kononovicius2023rtn"],

\begin{equation}
S\left(f\right)=\frac{a^{2}\bar{\nu}}{\pi^{2}f^{2}}\mathrm{Re}\left[\frac{\left(1-\chi\_{\theta}\left(f\right)\right)\left(1-\chi\_{\tau}\left(f\right)\right)}{1-\chi\_{\theta}\left(f\right)\chi\_{\tau}\left(f\right)}\right], \label{eq:general-result}
\end{equation}

to derive the spectral density when \\\( \tau\_i \\\) are sample from the
bounded Pareto distribution. We already know that characteristic function
for the exponential distribution (which in our case is the pulse duration
distribution) is given by

\begin{equation}
\chi\_{\theta}(f) = \frac{\lambda\_{\theta}}{\lambda\_{\theta} - 2 \pi \mathrm{i} f}
    = \frac{1}{1-2 \pi \mathrm{f} \theta\_c}
\end{equation}

Where in the above \\\( \theta\_c \\\) is the average pulse duration (i.e.,
\\\( \theta\_c = \langle \theta \rangle = \frac{1}{\lambda\_{\theta}} \\\)).

In this post we assume that gap times are sampled from the bounded Pareto
distribution, whose probability density function would be given by:

\begin{equation}
p\left(\tau\right)=
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{\alpha\tau\_{\text{min}}^{\alpha}}{1-\left(\frac{\tau\_{\text{min}}}{\tau\_{\text{max}}}\right)^{\alpha}}\cdot\frac{1}{\tau^{\alpha+1}} & \text{for }\tau\_{\text{min}}\leq\tau\leq\tau\_{\text{max}},\\\\
        0 & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

In the above, by the usual convention, \\\( \alpha > 0 \\\). The characteristic function of 
this distribution is then given by

\begin{equation}
\chi\_{\tau}\left(f\right)=\frac{\alpha\left(-2\pi\mathrm{i} f\tau\_{\text{min}}\tau\_{\text{max}}\right)^{\alpha}}{\tau\_{\text{max}}^{\alpha}-\tau\_{\text{min}}^{\alpha}}\cdot\left[\Gamma\left(-\alpha,-2\pi\mathrm{i} f\tau\_{\text{min}}\right)-\Gamma\left(-\alpha,-2\pi\mathrm{i} f\tau\_{\text{max}}\right)\right].
\end{equation}

Which is somewhat more complicated, thus let us approximate it for \\\( 0 <
\alpha < 2 \\\) with a notable exception of \\\( \alpha = 1 \\\) and for
\\\( \frac{1}{2\pi\tau\_{\text{max}}}\ll f\ll\frac{1}{2\pi\tau\_{\text{min}}}
\\\):

\begin{equation}
\chi\_{\tau}\left(f\right) \approx 1+\frac{\alpha}{\alpha-1}\cdot\left(2\pi\mathrm{i} f\tau\_{\text{min}}\right)-\Gamma\left(1-\alpha\right)\cdot\left(-2\pi\mathrm{i} f\tau\_{\text{min}}\right)^{\alpha}.
\end{equation}

Inserting the above characteristic functions into Eq. \eqref{eq:general-result} yields

\begin{equation}
S\left(f\right)=\frac{4a^{2}\bar{\nu}\theta\_{c}^{2}\left(2\pi f\tau\_{\text{min}}\right)^{\alpha}\cos\left(\frac{\pi\alpha}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(1-\alpha\right)}{\frac{4\pi^{2}f^{2}}{\left(\alpha-1\right)^{2}}\left[\left(\alpha-1\right)\theta\_{c}+\alpha\tau\_{\text{min}}\right]^{2}+\left(2\pi f\tau\_{\text{min}}\right)^{2\alpha}\Gamma\left(1-\alpha\right)^{2}}.\label{eq:full-psd}
\end{equation}

This expression is still rather complicated and hard to understand. What we
done in [cite id="Kononovicius2023rtn"] is that we considered its asymptotic
behavior in limiting cases. First in [cite id="Kononovicius2023rtn"] we have
considered short pulse duration case, i.e., \\\( \theta\_c \ll
\tau\_{\text{min}} \\\), which in the extreme scenario should be equivalent
to a point process (we have already discussed this in an [earlier
post]({filename}/articles/2023/point-process-psd-power-law.md)). In we have
confirmed that for \\\( 0 < \alpha < 1 \\\):

\begin{equation}
S(f) \sim \frac{1}{f^\alpha} ,
\end{equation}

and for \\\( 1 < \alpha < 2 \\\):

\begin{equation}
S(f) \sim \frac{1}{f^{2-\alpha}} .
\end{equation}

This peculiar behavior arises, because different terms dominate in the
denominator of Eq. \eqref{eq:full-psd}. For \\\( 0 < \alpha < 1 \\\), the
term involving \\\( f^{2\alpha} \\\) is the most significant of the two
terms in the denominator. While for confirmed that for \\\( 1 < \alpha < 2
\\\) it is easy to see that \\\( f^2 \\\) term dominates.

This peculiarity disappears if we consider long pulse duration case, i.e.,
\\\( \theta\_c \gg \tau\_{\text{min}} \\\). Then, for all non-integer \\\(
\alpha \\\), \\\( f^2 \\\) term dominates. So for the long pulse duration
case we have that:

\begin{equation}
S(f) \sim \frac{1}{f^{2-\alpha}} .
\end{equation}

These results suggest that for \\\( \alpha = 1 \\\) we should observe
[1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/), and in the existing literature it was so assumed. But as we
have seen in an [earlier
post]({filename}/articles/2023/point-process-psd-power-law.md)), for the
extremely short pulses no [1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/) is observed - the dependence
is perverted by the presence \\\( \ln f \\\) term.

## The special case of \\\( \alpha = 1 \\\)

With \\\( \alpha = 1 \\\), and for 
\\\( \frac{1}{2\pi\tau\_{\text{max}}}\ll f\ll\frac{1}{2\pi\tau\_{\text{min}}}
\\\), we have the following expression for the characteristic function of
gap time distribution

\begin{equation}
\chi\_{\tau}\left(f\right)=1-\pi^{2}f\tau\_{\text{min}}+\left[1-C\_{\gamma}-\ln\left(2\pi f\tau\_{\text{min}}\right)\right]\cdot\left(2\pi\mathrm{i} f\tau\_{\text{min}}\right).\label{eq:pareto-char-a1}
\end{equation}

Where, in the above, \\\( C\_{\gamma}=0.577\ldots \\\) is the Euler's gamma
constant. Inserting Eq. \eqref{eq:pareto-char-a1} into Eq.
\eqref{eq:general-result} yields

\begin{equation}
S\left(f\right)=\frac{a^{2}\bar{\nu}\tau\_{\text{min}}}{\left(\frac{\pi\tau\_{\text{min}}}{2\theta\_{c}}\right)^{2}+\left\\\{ 1+\frac{\tau\_{\text{min}}}{\theta\_{c}}\left[1-C\_{\gamma}-\ln\left(2\pi\tau\_{\text{min}}f\right)\right]\right\\\}^{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{f}.
\end{equation}

It should be evident that, if the pulses are short, then \\\( \ln f \\\)
term is significant. On the other hand, if the pulses are long, then for the
most parameters sets and realistically measurable frequencies pure
[1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/) is obtained

\begin{equation}
S\left(f\right) \approx a^{2}\bar{\nu}\tau\_{\text{min}}\cdot\frac{1}{f}.
\end{equation}

Still, if we consider all frequencies (or the formal mathematical \\\( f
\rightarrow 0 \\\) limit), then the obtained [1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/) would be
still perverted by the \\\( \ln f \\\) term. Though the cutoff frequency
would most often be unrealistically low:

\begin{equation}
f^{\left(c\right)}=\frac{1}{2\pi\tau\_{\text{min}}}\exp\left[-\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)\frac{\theta\_{c}}{\tau\_{\text{min}}}\right].
\end{equation}

If put the values used in the article [cite id="Kononovicius2023rtn"] or the
app below, then we get that \\\( f^{\left(c\right)}\approx10^{-180} \\\).
Measuring [power spectral density](/tag/spectral-density/) up to such
frequency is nearly impossible. This effectively offers an alternative
resolution to the low-frequency cutoff paradox [cite id="Niemann2013PRL"].

What does this model has to do with either \\\( f \rightarrow 0 \\\) limit
or the low-frequency cutoff paradox? Well, you can always take the \\\(
\tau\_{max} \rightarrow \infty \\\) limit. In simulation you would set \\\(
\tau\_{max} \\\) value much larger than the observation time (experiment
duration). This makes the model weakly non-ergodic and induces aging
effects. Namely, the total power of a signal (obtained by integrating the
[spectral density](/tag/spectral-density/) over observed frequencies) decays
as the observation time increases. For \\\( \alpha = 1 \\\) case, which
leads to [1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/), this decay is extremely slow, approximately

\begin{equation}
\int\_{1/T}^\infty S(f) \mathrm{d}f \propto \frac{1}{\ln(T)} .
\end{equation}

You won't be able to observe it unless you are actively looking for the
signs of the decrease. More details on the weakly non-ergodic case and the
exhibited aging effects are presented in [cite id="Kononovicius2023rtn"].

## Interactive app

This interactive app is somewhat similar to the app generating
[Lorentzian](/tag/lorentzian/) [spectral density](/tag/spectral-density/)
(see [this
post]({filename}/articles/2023/noise-generated-by-single-charge-carrier.md)).
The key difference is that here the app doesn't generate a single time
series of predefined length when the "Generate" button is pressed. Instead
it generates time series (and calculates the [spectral
density](/tag/spectral-density/) continuously until the "Stop" button is
pressed. When "Generate" button is pressed again, the parameters are reset
and the generation of new time series is started.

What to observe? You might want to try changing \\\( \theta\_c \\\) and
observe how the apparently pure [1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/) disappears. Also you
might want to change \\\( \alpha \\\) to observe the different slopes that
can emerge from this model.
