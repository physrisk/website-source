While briefly going back to the topic of [opinion
dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics/) let us become familiar with one possibly
unsolvable real-life problem. In other words, did you know that democracy is
mathematically impossible?

For a democratic decision making mechanism (e.g., elections) to work
properly, we must ensure that:

1. Choice rankings should be transitive. If choice A is preferred over choice
   B, and B is preferred over C, then A should be preferred over C.
1. Some decision should always be made. The mechanism simply can't "give up"
   under any however unusual circumstance.
1. There should be no dictators. The decision must not depend only on one
   voter's decision.
1. The mechanism should be unbiased, it should not impose any preference on
   the voters. If voters prefer choice A over choice B, this should be taken
   into account.
1. Voter preference between two alternatives should depend only on the two
   alternatives. For example, if a group of voter prefers choice A over
   choice B, then introduction choice C should not change the relative
   ranking of A and B.

Seems reasonable, but it is impossible as per the Arrow's impossibility
theorem [cite id="Arrow1950"]. Well, at least for ordinal (ranked) voting
systems. Watch the video below to get a popular summary on "why?".

By the end of the [video](/tag/video/) a possible solution is discussed.
Instead of using ranked voting systems we should use rated voting systems,
as first shown by D. Black [cite id="Black1948"]. I feel a bit skeptical
about this, as lots of people would likely get confused over what should
they write in their ballots. Furthermore, I am not sure if such voting is
impervious to strategic voting and would encourage truthful statement of the
preferences. Still, maybe?
