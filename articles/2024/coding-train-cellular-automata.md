Would you like to code your own [cellular automata](/tag/cellular-automata/)
program? Similar to our [Wolfram's elementary
automatons]({filename}/articles/2012/wolframs-elementary-automatons.md) or
(more than likely (partially because our app is really old)) better? Watch
the following video by the [Coding
Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) channel to learn how to do
that using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.
