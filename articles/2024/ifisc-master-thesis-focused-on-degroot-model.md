In a few recent posts we have looked at the [DeGroot
model]({filename}/articles/2024/degroot-model.md) and its
[generalizations](/tag/degroot-model/). In those posts I have mentioned that
while the models are somewhat old and could be considered to be classical,
they have resurfaced recently in the [opinion
dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics/) literature.

This recent Master thesis is an example of a study conducted using the
[DeGroot model]({filename}/articles/2024/degroot-model.md). Its novelty lies
in an exploration of in-group and out-group biases within the framework of
the [DeGroot model]({filename}/articles/2024/degroot-model.md). We invite
you to watch the recording of the defense presentation shared by
[IFISC](/tag/ifisc/).
