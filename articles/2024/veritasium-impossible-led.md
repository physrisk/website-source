The following video bears some relevance to our recent discussions on
modeling [1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/). While it doesn't delve directly into
the topic of [1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/), it offers insights into relevant
physics and engineering challenges which arose when trying to make an
efficient blue LED.
