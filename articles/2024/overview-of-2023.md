Over the last few years we have been keeping a steady pace of 33 posts a
year. Though in the 2023 we have managed to produce one more post containing
an [interactive app](/tag/interactive-models/).

![Number of posts written in English and still available on this site as of
the end of 2023]({static}/uploads/2024/overview-of-2023.png "The number of
posts written in English and still available on this iteration of Physics of
Risk (as of the end of 2023). The wide bars represent total number of posts
for each year since 2010, while the narrower bars represent a number of
posts containing an interactive app.")

This year we have mostly focused on the various properties of [Poisson
processes](/tag/poisson-process/) and related topics (such as [point
processes](/tag/point-process/) and [shot noise](/tag/shot-noise)).
Otherwise we have finished a series of posts from the 2022 on the
statistical modeling of [dating apps](/tag/dating-apps-series/).

What is coming in 2024? Well, most likely we will have few more posts
dedicated to our recent works on the [random telegraph
noise](/tag/random-telegraph-noise/). Then I will likely tell you about my
woes with football themed board game
[Eleven](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/329716/eleven-football-manager-board-game).
While it is highly thematic, it has some glaring issues which I wanted to
fix with science! Well, numerical simulation at least.
