This year we have finally managed to attend [DPG Spring Meeting of the
Condensed Matter Section 2024](https://berlin24.dpg-tagungen.de/). We have
listened to quite a few interesting contributions and received valuable
feedback on our own research.

My master's degree student Justas Kvedaravi훾ius showcased his research
endeavors spanning both his bachelor's and master's studies in a compelling
poster presentation. His research delved into the measurement of
spatio-hierarchical heterogeneity and the analysis of rank dynamics within
the [compartmental voter
model]({filename}/articles/2020/compartmental-voter-model.md). Notably, his
most recent exploration of rank dynamics, along with his journey to present
at the conference, received a financial support from the Research Council of
Lithuania through the student research project (during the semester) grant
titled "Analysis of the compartmental voter model in terms of rank dynamics"
(Grant No. S-ST-23-122).

I myself have presented my recent endeavors (in collaboration with a member
of our group prof. B. Kaulakys) on modeling [1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/)
using model with non-overlapping rectangular pulses (although I have broken
this assumption in my presentation), and exploration of the poll-induced
delays in the [voter model](/tag/voter-model/) (in collaboration with R.
Astrauskas, M. Radavi훾ius and F. Ivanauskas from Faculty of Mathematics and
Informatics). Notably, my trip was supported by Vilnius universties Science
Promotion Fund.

I have presented my collaborative research efforts, conducted with prof.  B.
Kaulakys from our group, focusing on modeling [1/f noise](/tag/1f-noise/).
Our approach involved utilizing a model with non-overlapping rectangular
pulses (things we have been writing about recently, for example, see [this
post]({filename}/articles/2023/noise-generated-by-single-charge-carrier.md),
although I also did address the breaking of this assumption during my talk.
I gave another talk as well, in which I discussed the impliciations of
poll-induced delays to the phenomenology of the voter model, research
conducted in collaboration with R. Astrauskas, M. Radavi훾ius, and F.
Ivanauskas from the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics. Notably, my
attendance at the event was made possible through support from the Vilnius
University Science Promotion Fund.
