Soon we will kick off with a new topic entirely. The topic will not be outside the
scope of Physics of Risk, but to a completely different subject still within our
research interests. Namely, we will move on to cover some of the most well known
or otherwise interesting models of the [opinion dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics).

Note that we have already covered a few [opinion dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics)
models. Such as
[Galam's referendum model]({filename}/articles/2014/many-particle-interaction-in-the-kinetic-exchange-models.md),
[Voter model]({filename}/articles/2016/rinkejo-modelis.md),
[AB model]({filename}/articles/2017/ab-modelis.md) and
[Axelrod's culture dissemination model]({filename}/articles/2018/axelrod-model.md).
Though we haven't discussed it in detail
[Bass diffusion model]({filename}/articles/2011/unidirectional-kirman-model.md)
as well as [Kirman's model](/tag/kirman-model/) could be also seen as opinion
dynamics models. Though we have applied in a very different context, in their
pure form both of them are about opinions than other rational arguments. Recently
I even have published a generalized [Kirman's model](/tag/kirman-model/) to describe
N-state dynamics and applied the generalized model to reproduce Lithuanian
parliamentary election results [cite id="Kononovicius2017Complexity,Kononovicius2018APPA"].
