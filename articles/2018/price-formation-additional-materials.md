Couple of months ago I have started a [series of posts](/tag/topic-price-formation/) on price formation in the free market or how and why the free market does (not) work. [Last time]({filename}/articles/2018/price-formation-concluding-remarks.md) I have provided concluding remarks on this topic. But would like to share some additional materials.

One link will be interesting to our Lithuanian readers - it is interview of economist Gitaunas NausÄ—da to lrytas.tv in which he tries to explain why prices are growing in Lithuania (click [here](https://tv.lrytas.lt/laidos/lietuva-tiesiogiai/2017/08/31/news/gitanas-nauseda-paaiskino-kodel-lietuvoje-auga-kainos-2392128/)).

The other is a lecture from Crash Course Economics, which explains laws of supply and demand. Look through their other videos to get full Economics 101.
