Here on Physics of Risk we often are interested in the power spectral density
of the time series. We have earlier provided a couple of interactive examples
(see [here]({filename}/articles/2013/power-spectral-density-part-1.md),
[here]({filename}/articles/2013/power-spectral-density-part-2.md) and
[here]({filename}/articles/2012/colors-of-noise.md)) illustrating the concept
as well as a brief introductory discussion. In this post we would like to
suggest viewing a video by 3Blue1Brown in which an interesting intuition on this
very topic is provided in a very fascinating manner.
