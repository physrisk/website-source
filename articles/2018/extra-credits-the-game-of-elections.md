Let us start our new series on opinion dynamics slowly, but steadily. Let us
first invite you to watch a related series of videos from the
[Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg). In
these series the EC team briefly describe the complex system behind the
elections in the US as if it was well (or not so well) crafted computer game.
Watch it! It is rather interesting and inspiring to think about the formation
and expression of the opinions yourself.
