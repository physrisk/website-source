Long ago we have implemented a simple traffic model, Nagel-Schreckenberg
model (see [this post]({filename}/articles/2014/stop-and-go-waves.md)).
This model demonstrates how small errors or perturbations to traffic flow
could amplify and cause traffic jams.

Further research in this direction suggests that we could slightly modify
cruise control present in the most modern cars to try prevent traffic jams.
A small change would be needed - cars just have to keep the same distance
from the car in front of them as well as from the car behind them. See this
Seeker video for more details.
