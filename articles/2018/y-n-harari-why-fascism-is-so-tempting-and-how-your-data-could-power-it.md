Though this topic and the way it is presented differs from the usual way we
write our posts, but this [TED](https://www.ted.com/talks/yuval_noah_harari_why_fascism_is_so_tempting_and_how_your_data_could_power_it)
talk by a historian Y. N. Harari shares similar foundations. Y. N. Harari talks
about the possible political phase transition (from democracy to fascism) and how
the [Big data](/tag/data-science/) could empower it. We invite you to ponder about
this material.
