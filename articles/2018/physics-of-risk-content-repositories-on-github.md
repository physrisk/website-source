Previously we have recommended people willing to reuse or modify our code to simply view the source code of our interactive html/javascript apps. Over the last few days we have updated our interactive app development workflow and this method will no longer work. When viewing the source code in your favorite browser, you will now see the minified (uglified) code. While the apps should still work as usual, it would be hard to modify them. We have setup a github repository for our development code (see [https://github.com/akononovicius/physRisk-model-repository](https://github.com/akononovicius/physRisk-model-repository)).

While we are at it, we have also setup a github repository for our content (see [https://github.com/akononovicius/physRisk-content-repository](https://github.com/akononovicius/physRisk-content-repository)). This repository will store markdown files of our posts and pages.
