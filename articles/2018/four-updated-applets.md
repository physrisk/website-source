In the recent few days we have replaced another four Java applets
with their HTML5 counterparts. The following articles were updated:<!--more-->

* <del>[Agent-based herding model of financial markets]({filename}/articles/2011/agent-based-herding-model-financial-markets.md),</del>
* [Long-range memory stochastic model of return]({filename}/articles/2010/long-range-memory-stochastic-model-return.md),
* [Three group Kirmanâ€™s agent-based model for financial markets]({filename}/articles/2011/three-group-kirman-agent-based-model-for-financial-markets.md),
* [Burst statistics in non-linear stochastic models]({filename}/articles/2011/burst-statistics-non-linear-stochastic-models.md),

Two more applets are still
[to be replaced]({filename}/articles/2014/future-of-java-applets-and-how-to-launch-java-applets.md).
It is likely that multifractality applet will also be soon upgraded,
but reimplementing Newton-Raphson applet is extremely chalenging task...

So I have made the code behind the NeRFEx main program (the applet
was adapted from it) on GitHub in hopes that somebody would be interested
and adopt it (find the repository
[here](https://github.com/akononovicius/NeRFEx-newton-raphson-fractal-explorer)).
I have also made available the code of another "ancient" Java applet,
implementing visualization of Mandelbrot and Julia sets, developed for
Physics of Risk back in the 2006-2008 time period (find the repository
[here](https://github.com/akononovicius/Mandelbrot-Julia-applet)).

**edit:** A minor factual error - only three applets were updated recently,
the fourth one was updated long ago.
