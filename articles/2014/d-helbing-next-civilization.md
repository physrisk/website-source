In this TED talk (recorded for independent TED event)
prof. Dirk Helbing talks about the insights, which might be gained from
a dialogue between different fields of science (social and physical).
This dialogue may event elevate the current civilization to the new
level in which we would be able to understand the complexity of our
world. This understanding could provide us tools to make optimal,
responsible and rational decision making.
