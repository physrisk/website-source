[Previously](/aleksejus-kononovicius-socializmas-ir-kapitalizmas-kinetiniuose-modeliuose)
we wrote about the confrontation between the socialistic and
capitalistic economic thought. We have looked into it from a point of
view of elementary kinetic exchange models. While in our world, in the
international context, we frequently hear about it via media, which
tends to use it to explain the disagreements between China and USA or
Russia and USA. Clearly those countries have different economical and
political models, but are they the same as media tends to present them?
We invite you to listen to two talks given by scientists (posted on
[ted.com](http://www.ted.com)) - one talk is about China's [economical
model](http://www.ted.com/talks/dambisa_moyo_is_china_the_new_idol_for_emerging_economies.html),
while the other is about China's [political
model](http://www.ted.com/talks/eric_x_li_a_tale_of_two_political_systems.html).<!--more-->
