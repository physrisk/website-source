It appears that computational history can be very
realistic and scientifically plausible field of research. It somewhat
reminds the legendary Civilization computer game, but explains what
actually may contributed to the formation of the human societies. The
essence of the Civilization game is a very simple one - the players must
lead their civilizations to become a grand futuristic empire. As
reported in the article linked below, the main result of the research
is that the military technology and warfare is mostly responsible for
the formation of the organized human societies. The first people faced a
tough challenge - if they were not organized, they were simple wiped
off.
