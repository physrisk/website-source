B. Mandelbrot is probably
one of the most well known mathematicians of the second half of the 20th
century. As a scientist he was interested in the "strange" fractal
geometry. In this TED talk he draws our attention to the naturally
occurring complexity we observe everyday, but which is left unnoticed by
our eyes. In this talk he briefly and in very simple terms explains the
basic concepts of fractal geometry. We invite you to listen to this
great man speak.
