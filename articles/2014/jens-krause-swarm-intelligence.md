Have you ever wondered how the human crowd
works? Why a bunch of total strangers are able to interact in away,
which forms interesting and long-living structures? How the appraently
mindless animals are able to do the same? Insights to the question might
be gained by listening to the talk "[Swarm
Intelliegence](https://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Swarm-Intelligence-Jens-Krause)"
by dr. Jens Krause at TEDx event in Gent, Belgium. Apparently the
features of the crow behavior, and thus the research, is highly
universal and therefore may enable understanding of the inner-workings
of the human societies. Below you will a recording of this talk, which
is made available on
YouTube.

We have listened to dr. Jens Krause live at one of the Spring meetings
of German physicists' society (DPG). Namely this research has inspired
us to analyze [the impact of the controlled agents on the dynamics of
the Kirman
model]({filename}/articles/2013/impact-controlled-agents-dynamics-Kirman-model.md).
