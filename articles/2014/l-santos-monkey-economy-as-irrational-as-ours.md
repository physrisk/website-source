People are
exceptionally rational, no other species are able to complete the tasks
people are able to. But the people are also appear to be unique in a
sense that they tend to make mistakes. Same silly mistakes over and over
again. Is this error-proness a consequence of the rationality? Would
assumingly less rational beings do the same mistakes? Laurie Santos (and
her team) have conducted a series of experiments on the capuchin monkeys
and have seen how the irrationality is also present in the monkey
economics or "monkeynomics" for short. We invite you to listen her
talk.
