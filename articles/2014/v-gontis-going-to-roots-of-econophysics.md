On 9<sup>th</sup>
of November I have finally left for Boston University. There, at the
Center of Polymer Studies, I will spend almost a year working with the
most prominent econophysicists (such as H. E. Stanley, who is one of
most well cited contemporary physicists). This opportunity to visit
Boston University was provided by the Baltic-American Freedom
Foundation. H. E. Stanley is one of the founding fathers of

systems as well as in social behavior observed in biological systems.
