It appears that
our "Baltic sister" Estonia also has some econophycists. The main area
of research of the Estonian econophysicists are the kinetic exchange
models, while there are also some works related to the multifractility
of the time series. From a pedagogical point of view the situation is
similar to what we have in Lithuania - there is no formal education, but
some seminars are red. Feel free to deeper familiarize yourself with
econophysics in Estonia by reading an article by M. Patriarca et al.
