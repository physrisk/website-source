It appears that socio-economical regularities
may be understood not only by using physical or mathematical intuition
or even by using the ideas from social sciences. It appears that even
philologists may have something to say about our socio-economical. For
example the tendency to willingness to save money for the future may be
dependent on if our mother-tongue is futureless or not (do we say "It
rain tomorrow" or "It will rain tomorrow"? e.g., German may be seen as a
futureless language, while Lithuanian and English have strongly
differing future tense). Bellow you will find two videos - [one made by
eBay Deals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3G51gDHTXE), which provides
a broad outlook, and [another recorded by
TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/keith_chen_could_your_language_affect_your_ability_to_save_money.html "Video on ted.com"),
in which K. Chen presents his research, - which present this kind of
research in more detail.<!--more-->

In the context of Physics of Risk it also worth to mention that the
language dynamics (the evolution of the popularity of the language)
themselves may be explained by using physical insights \[cite
