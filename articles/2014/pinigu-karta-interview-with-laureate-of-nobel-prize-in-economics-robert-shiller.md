Few weeks
ago Robert J. Shiller, laureate of Nobel prize in economics, was in
Lithuania and even gave an open lecture at ISM ("openness" is rather
doubtful in this case, because ordinary mortals were unable to attend).
The good thing was that the lecture was broadcasted over the internet.
Another good thing was that creators of "Pinigų karta" (one of the more
serious TV shows about money and economics in Lithuania) invited this
famous person for a brief interview and he accepted. We invite you to
watch it (don't be discouraged - only first few seconds are in
Lithuanian!).
