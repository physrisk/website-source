When we started to work on "Physics of Risk" Java
platform was extremely popular way to show interactive material to
readers online. Though this technology is still rather popular, but
there is a significant challenge for amateurs working with it. Since the
previous glorious days Java platform has become less secure and thus
more paranoid. As the time moves on newer Java Runtime Environment
versions start require applets to be certified. Certificates are not
that cheap and thus not accessible to amateur programers.

The good news is that HTML5 standard has becoming more popular on web
and that it also offers presentation of interactive content via
Javascript. Thus we plan to migrate most of the old Java applets to this
emerging technology. These new HTML5 applets should work in all modern
web browsers as the implementation of HTML5 by the most popular modern
browsers was started a few years ago. Therefore we do not expect any
problems occurring to you, our readers.

In the mean time, we present a list of articles, which include old Java
applets, and also provide a detailed instruction on how to launch Java
applets.<!--more-->

The updated applets will be checked off the list (similarly to the
[Unidirectional Kirman
model](/unidirectional-kirman-model "Unidirectional Kirman model"),
which was checked off at publication). The applets most probably will be
updated in the same order as in this list.

How to launch Java applets?
---------------------------

Open Windows Control Panel and find Java control panel in it.

![java-control-panel](/uploads/2014/java-control-panel.jpg)

Let's open Security tab and append Site List.

![java-control-panel-2](/uploads/2014/java-control-panel-2.jpg)

You should add http://mokslasplius.lt.

![java-control-panel-3](/uploads/2014/java-control-panel-3.jpg)

![java-control-panel-4](/uploads/2014/java-control-panel-4.jpg)

A warning about "security risk" should appear. Simply press "Continue".

![java-control-panel-5](/uploads/2014/java-control-panel-5.jpg)

Leave Java control panel by pressing "OK" several times.

Now you should open your browser and an article on "Physics of Risk"
with Java applet in it. E.g., [Wolfram's elementary
automatons](/wolframs-elementary-automatons "Wolframs elementary automatons").

Press "Activate Java Platform" button.

![java-browser](/uploads/2014/java-browser.jpg)

Choose between temporary ("Allow Now") and permanent exception ("Allow
and Remember").

![java-browser-2](/uploads/2014/java-browser-2.jpg)

Just press "Run" and use the applet.

![java-browser-3](/uploads/2014/java-browser-3.jpg)

![java-browser-4](/uploads/2014/java-browser-4.jpg)

This step-by-step instruction was prepared using Windows 7, Firefox 29
and Java SE Runtime Environment 7u55. On other versions of Windows or
with other browser operations might slightly differ, but in their
essence should be the same.
