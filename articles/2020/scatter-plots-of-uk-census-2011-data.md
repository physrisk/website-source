Let us continue examining UK census 2011 data set (see
[the previous post]({filename}/articles/2020/rank-size-distribution-and-uk-census-2011-data.md)).
This time the app uses scatter plots, which allow us to see whether some
socio-demographic parameters are correlated to other socio-demographic
parameters. While some of such findings are just spurious correlations, other
times some other explanation could easily be found.

[Once again]({filename}/articles/2020/rank-size-distribution-and-uk-census-2011-data.md)
we use UK census 2011 data set, which is freely from
[NOMIS website](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/select/getdatasetbytheme.asp?opt=3&theme=&subgrp=)).
Here we continue using Tables KS201EW, KS209EW, KS301EW, KS402EW and QS607EW.
Our geographical resolution being postal areas.
