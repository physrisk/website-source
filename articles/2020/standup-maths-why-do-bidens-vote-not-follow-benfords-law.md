There are many unsubstantiated claim about election fraud in the recent US
presidential elections. Most of these claims provide no proofs or arguments,
while there are few which are supposedly scientific. One of the example relies
on the [Benford's law](/tag/benford-law), which specifies the expected
frequency at which we should observe specific first digit of certain number. So
if vote counts in polling stations do not follow Benford's law, it should be
an indication of wide spread fraud!

Not so fast, as often in science, laws and models are applicable only when
certain conditions (assumptions) are satisfied. In case of
[Benford's law](/tag/benford-law), one main condition is that the original
numbers (first digits of which we consider) should span multiple orders of
magnitude. Also [Benford's law](/tag/benford-law) is formulated as a rather
general empirical observation. The law is supposedly observed in many
naturally occurring data.

Vote counts is obviously an example of naturally occurring data. The issue is
that vote counts do not span many order of magnitude. Also vote counts,
especially in elections with two competitors, are not related to exponential
growth (which is prevalent in many naturally occurring systems), which can
actually be a driver for the [Benford's law](/tag/benford-law).

Watch the following video by Stand-up Maths for a video discussion on
applicability of the [Benford's law](/tag/benford-law) to the data from the
recent presidential election in the US. The video below covers another
simple method to check for the election fraud.
