Most people hate math and (I would like to claim that) they hate
[statistics](/tag/statistics/) even more, because statistics are often harder
to understand than everyday geometry, compound interest or any other everyday
math problem. Yet understanding [statistics](/tag/statistics/) is vitally
important for many everyday decisions. While we can't fix the larger problem in
just one post, we can suggest an interesting talk by Jennifer Rogers given at
the [Royal Institution](/tag/the-royal-institution/) about statistical lies
and how not to fall for them.
