It seems that COVID-19 "wind" has blown on the house of cards, which we have
been carefully rebuilding since 2008 crisis. Though the markets are not the
economy, but the economy is likely to stall as it did after so many crashes
before. We invite you to watch an Extra History episode (by
[Extra Credits](/tag/extra-credits/)), which provides historical retrospective
on The 1929 Crash, which was followed by The Great Depression.
