Two years ago I have covered a classical price discovery model known as the
[Cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md). While the premise of
the model is rather simple, its internal logic seemed flawed to me. Yet at that
time I didn't know how to properly explore its flaws.

A bit later on I started exploring [order book](/tag/order-book/) models and
one of the simplest ones, the
[efficient market marker model]({filename}/articles/2018/emm-order-book-model.md),
caught my eye and reminded me that I want to explore some issues regarding the 
[Cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md).

This post (and accompanying app) sat in my "unpublished" folder for a long
time, until I have rediscovered it lately and worked out few things which
bugged me in this approach. So here, in this post, I will present you with an
interactive app, which combines both of these models. I will also provide some
discussion on why the combination of these models doesn't work as expected.

## Combined model

Note that this is not a true agent-based model as buyers and suppliers are not
heterogeneous and are effectively represented by a single agent. Efficient
market maker is the third agent we will meet in this model.

So, from the [Cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md) we have
the supply and the demand laws. As in the original post these laws can be
manipulate by adjusting the respective slopes, \\\( \alpha\_s \\\) and
\\\( \alpha\_d \\\). To add more flexibility to the model we have decided to
allow users to change the location of the equilibrium point,
\\\( \( Q\_{eq}, P\_{eq} \) \\\). The dynamics of the combined model depend on
this point only quantitatively, but not only qualitatively.

While from the
[efficient market marker model]({filename}/articles/2018/emm-order-book-model.md)
we borrow the probability that the market maker will submit the limit order of
the same type as the recent market order was, \\\( p \\\). In other words, this
probability describes the likelihood that the price will move after executing
market order.

The connection between the models is made by assuming that market order
submission rates (ones from the
[efficient market marker model]({filename}/articles/2018/emm-order-book-model.md)),
\\\( \lambda^{+} \\\) and \\\( \lambda^{-} \\\), depend on the existing supply
and demand respectively, which are calculated by the means of respective laws
given by the [Cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md). These
rates are updated each \\\( \delta \\\) time units.

## Dynamics of the model

Sadly, the combined model is always stable. At least in a sense that the price
will never diverge. This is because efficient market maker will always provide
some "backup" supply or demand, if endogenous (one generated by the agents)
supply or demand fails.

Though note that the model discovers the equilibrium point, but only if
\\\( p \\\) is not too big. The convergence is well predicted by the supply
and demand laws (the points initially follow the lines quite nicely), but the
discovery occurs in a very different fashion than it is predicted by the
original [Cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md). Furthermore
fluctuations around the equilibrium point do not follow the laws well (the
points notably deviate away from the lines).

If \\\( p \\\) is close to \\\( 1 \\\), large fluctuations of the price and the
production will be observed. In these cases quite often we will have lack of
supply or demand. If this happens, then the efficient market maker saves the
market from collapse by providing "backup" demand or supply. Note that this
collapse (increase in volatility) is not observed in the original
[Cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md). Furthermore the
volatility will be observed even when the classical model would suggest that
the market should be stable. This difference arises purely from the power of
such market maker. Efficient market maker both stabilizes the market by
providing "backup" demand and supply, but also destabilizes the market by
overreacting to the excess demand and supply generated by the endogenous
agents.

**Conclusion?** While the
[Cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md) framework clearly
fails to predict the dynamics of the combined model, these failures are easy to
understand. Furthermore, I am not very happy with the approach I took here (as
in reality there are no efficient and omnipotent market makers). So no
conclusions this time.

## Disclaimer

Note that this model is a product of my inquiries to the nature of the
[Cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2018/cobweb-model.md). This exploration
might not make a lot of sense to a person more familiar with
[Economics](/tag/economics) than myself.
