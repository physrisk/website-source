Last time we have proposed the
[agent-based cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2020/cobweb-abm.md). In certain
case price time series of this model exhibit different volatility. So this time
we will take a look at price change statistics in this model. As is common for
our [financial markets](/tag/financial-markets) posts we will consider
probability density functions and spectral density.

Not much theory behind this post. Using the app below you can freely explore
statistics generated by the
[agent-based cobweb model]({filename}/articles/2020/cobweb-abm.md). At least we
were unable to find parameter sets with which the model would exhibit
statistics similar to the stylized facts (1/f spectral density and power law
probability density). But maybe you will find such parameter set.
