Today we celebrate 10 years since our
[English "Hello World" post]({filename}/articles/2010/hello-world.md)! While
it was not the first post on Physics of Risk, (we were writing posts in
Lithuanian since 2006), nor it was the first post written in English (a post
on [Kirman's ants]({filename}/articles/2010/kirman-ants.md) was published on
April 11, 2010), it is still an important post, which marks our transition to
writing in English.

It is interesting to see if we will survive another 10 years.
