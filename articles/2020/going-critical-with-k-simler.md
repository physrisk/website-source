We have talked a lot about the [opinion dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics/)
recently, thus before going on summer holiday, we would like to share a very
relevant post by a computational linguist K. Simler. In the said post he
explores the complexity of social systems from the point of view of various
[network topologies](/tag/networks/) on which a diffusion process
(which can be either [contagion](/tag/epidemiology/) or
[idea and information spread](/tag/opinion-dynamics/)) plays out. This tutorial
also involves a lot of neat interactive apps.

We encourage you to explore "Going critical" on
<https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/going-critical/>.

See you after the summer holidays!
