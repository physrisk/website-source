Another video on [epidemiology](/tag/epidemiology) by Youtube creator I really
like watching. In this video by [3Blue1Brown](/tag/3blue1brown) you will see a
few variations of epidemiological [agent-based model](/tag/agent-based-models)
each of which explore various disease containment strategies. Also, this video
is another chance to understand that disease tend to spread (exponentially) fast.

At least for me key take away is the effect of a small fraction of people who
do not follow social distancing. Those who treat quarantine as a windfall
holiday or as an infringement of their personal freedoms. While the curve will
still be reasonably flattened, time to fully eradicate the disease grows much
longer. This means that society as a whole will have to suffer even longer
quarantine, which could result in various social, economical and other
health-related side effects.

Don't be an idiot. Stay home.
