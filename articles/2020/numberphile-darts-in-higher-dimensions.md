It might sound strange, but statistics and geometry are very much related.
Result in one is likely to have some meaning in the other. This time Numberphile
has teamed up with another my favorite 3Blue1Brown to explore a game using
darts.

As it is assumed that a random (unskilled) player plays the game, his plays
simply explore a continuous phase space. Each point in the said phase space
corresponding to all possible events in the game. To keep playing the game the
player has to satisfy a condition, which provides us a boundary in the phase
spaces. Conveniently geometric shape enclosed by the boundary is a ball (or a
hyper-sphere). So our problem of calculating probability is reduced to a problem
of figuring out the ball's volume in respect to the size of phase space. More
details in the video below.
