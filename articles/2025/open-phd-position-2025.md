**Topic:** Change and exchange processes in complex social systems

**Description:** Opinion dynamics, a core aspect of the complex social
systems research, delves into the process of opinion change. Physical
spin-based models offer a convenient framework for modeling opinion
dynamics. Thus, current literature focuses on the phase transitions arising
under the influence of various semi-realistic social mechanisms. However,
this approach does not result in empirically verifiable models. Also, these
models feature unrealistically frequent individual opinion shifts. This PhD
research topic will consider the aforementioned shortcomings by exploring
novel variations of the noisy voter model combining opinion change and
spatial exchange processes. Introducing spatial dimension aligns the models
with the empirical data, which is usually spatial, and allows for a decrease
in the frequency of individual opinion change. Furthermore, these models
should apply to various social contexts, from exploring the relationship
between socio-demographics, political opinions, and societal attention
dynamics to trading different assets in financial markets.

**Supervisor:** [Aleksejus Kononovicius](https://kononovicius.lt/)
