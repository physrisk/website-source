Last Sunday in Lithuania, a protest took place against the proposed changes
to property tax laws. The protest itself reminded me of a
[video](/tag/video/) I watched some time ago. The video was about Georgism -
an idea that most taxes could be abolished (or significantly reduced) if we
instead taxed land more heavily.

While I think Georgist land value taxation is a not perfect solution, it is
an interesting alternative worth our consideration. Especially, as a
replacement for the typical taxation of labor. I invite you to watch an
introductory video by [BritMonkey](https://www.youtube.com/@BritMonkey).
