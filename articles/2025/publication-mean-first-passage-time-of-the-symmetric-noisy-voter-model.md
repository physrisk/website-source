Our most recent work [cite id="Kazakevicius2026CSF"] concerning the first
passage time problem in the noisy voter model has been published in Chaos,
Solitons and Fractals! The mean first passage time is a prominent tool that
quantifies fundamental switching behavior in systems ranging from natural to
social sciences. While, the noisy voter model is a prominent model used to
understand human opinion dynamics.
