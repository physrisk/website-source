Our most recent work [cite id="Kazakevicius2026CSF"] concerning the first
passage time problem in the noisy voter model has been [published in Chaos,
Solitons and Fractals](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2025.117649)!

The mean first passage time is a prominent tool that quantifies fundamental
switching behavior in systems ranging from natural to social sciences. In
our earlier works the [first-passage framework](/tag/first-passage-time/)
has found applications as a [test for long-range
memory](/tag/burst-statistics/) [cite id="Kazakevicius2021Entropy"]. While,
the noisy voter model is a prominent model used to understand human opinion
dynamics.
