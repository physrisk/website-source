Continuing the ongoing tradition (see the
[post]({filename}/articles/2024/abm-tutorial-in-english-2024.md) from last
year), I gave another two lecture tutorial introducing Master degree students
to the physics of socio-economic phenomena. This time, the tutorial's focus
has shifted from [agent-based modeling](/tag/agent-based-models/) towards
[complex systems](/tag/complex-systems/) and scale-free phenomena
point-of-view. I was looking for a way to present this research area to
physics students, but I have to admit that Mantegna's and Stanley's approach
is indeed superior (see [cite id="Mantegna1999CUP"]).
