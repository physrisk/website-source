This summer, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) ran a series
of guest videos. One of them is particularly interesting for the fans of
[statistical physics](/tag/statistical-physics/). The video describes
physical and mathematical details of the simulation of the phase change.

The second video goes into the mathematical analysis of the vapor-liquid
model (which is notably very much like the [Ising model](/tag/ising-model/) we
mention occasionally). It is available on the [Spectral
Collective](https://www.youtube.com/@SpectralCollective) Youtube channel.
