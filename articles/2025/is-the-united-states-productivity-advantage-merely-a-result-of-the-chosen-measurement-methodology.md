Global economic media frequently report that U.S. productivity has been
growing much faster than in Europe and other developed Western economies for
many years. As an example, consider the [recent publication in the Financial
Times
(FT)](https://www.ft.com/content/cbfd8af4-b3a8-4ade-9831-6cb7cf836745). This
is not journalistic exaggeration—such conclusions follow directly from the
still widely used methodology of calculating real GDP and productivity, and
from international comparisons based on that methodology.

The FT article clearly illustrates that Europe's economic lag behind the
United States is treated as an objective reality at the highest levels of
politics, and that policymakers have been searching for ways to "close this
gap" for many years. We present these remarks because doubts about the
magnitude of the United States’ economic advantage naturally arise from the
study of international macroeconomics and economic growth theory.

## The standard approach

GDP and productivity have long been calculated in constant prices as "real"
variables to separate price changes from quantitative increases in
production. This is meaningful and partly justified when comparing different
periods within the same country. Since our concern is international
comparison, we show that the elimination of price growth (as measured by the
GDP deflator) is not unambiguous when inflation differs across countries.

International macroeconomics typically uses the following definition of
productivity at constant prices:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Prod}\_t=\frac{Y\_t^{real}}{PPP\_0 L\_t}
\end{equation}

where \\\( Y\_t^{real} \\\) is real GDP at constant national prices, \\\(
PPP\_0 \\\) is the purchasing power parity exchange rate calculated in a
chosen benchmark year, \\\( L\_t \\\) is labor input measured as population,
employment, or total hours worked.

It is assumed that this measure reflects real productivity changes well.
Real GDP removes domestic inflation, while the fixed PPP removes changes in
international price levels. However, this choice ignores the interaction
among productivity, wages, and prices. The Penn effect—which identifies the
relationship between prices and GDP—and its Balassa–Samuelson theoretical
explanation appear to be overlooked.

## Real GDP does not sufficiently separate output from price changes

It is not difficult to see that changes in currency values and prices affect
different components of the economy with very different time lags. For
example, wage adjustments occur much later than price changes in
internationally traded goods and services. These lags may span several
years.

Therefore, changes in real GDP are not independent of exchange rate and
price-level changes: later wage increases, triggered by earlier inflation,
are reflected in real GDP as increases in the quantity of goods and services
produced. Thus, two countries with identical economic capacity in terms of
physical production may exhibit different real GDP and productivity values
simply because of differing inflation dynamics.

In catching-up economies, wages systematically lag behind prices, yet
nominal GDP rises in step with them. Because wages adjust later, this
convergence is primarily due to price-level equalization, not an actual
increase in physical production. Although this inflation-driven convergence
mechanism eventually supports investment, technological upgrading, and
genuine productivity growth, measured economic growth is not solely the
outcome of internal economic relationships—it is also the result of complex
international macroeconomic interactions.

## The Penn effect reveals the true dynamics of GDP and productivity

A simplified account of the Penn effect illustrates the impact of international economic interactions:

1. Productivity growth in internationally traded sectors raises wages
   throughout the entire economy.
1. Higher wages raise the general price level, including the prices of goods
   and services traded only domestically. The price levels of less developed
   countries gradually converge toward those of advanced economies.

A significant part of the measured growth in real productivity is therefore
merely the result of international price-level convergence, not an actual
increase in production.

Central and Eastern European countries such as Lithuania, Poland, and
Romania are converging toward Western Europe partly because of faster
price-level growth—not solely due to increased production or improved
efficiency. In our view, a similar discrepancy in measured productivity
growth exists even across developed Western economies, because membership in
different monetary policy regimes leads to divergent price dynamics.

Global economic media often overlook the limitations of constant-PPP GDP
measurement and present the United States’ economic advantage over Europe as
an indisputable fact. European policymakers likewise reproach themselves as
they search for real and imagined causes of this divergence. Mario Draghi's
report has fueled endless debate. Because we have serious theoretical doubts
about the reported European lag, we provide publicly available comparative
results along with methodological commentary.

## Comparison of U.S. and European productivity

The comparison can be performed using various data sources. We choose OECD
data, which is also referenced in the cited FT article. As explained above,
differing price-level dynamics may be responsible for differences in
measured productivity. Therefore, in Figure 1 we compare PPP changes in the
U.S. and European countries.

much local currency must be paid in a given country for a good that costs 1
dollar in the United States.")

Between 2002 and 2008, a rapid shift in relative price levels occurred,
likely driven by a highly aggressive U.S. monetary policy. This difference
has persisted, and the gap between Europe and the U.S. is now even larger
than the differences between old and new EU member states. Such a
significant increase in the U.S. price level is an essential issue in
contemporary global economic relations.

As explained above, it may also contribute to faster measured productivity
growth when productivity is calculated in constant prices. Because U.S.
wages continue to adjust to higher prices, the formal calculations portray
this as an additional increase in productivity. If productivity were
measured as GDP per hour worked calculated using current PPP, the U.S.
advantage would not look apparent at all (see Figure 2, which shows GDP per
hour in current-price PPP dollars).

"Productivity comparison between the U.S. and Europe using PPP with current
dollar prices.")

In our view, the faster productivity growth observed in the U.S.—see Figure
3—is a consequence of the long-standing methodological choice to compare
countries using GDP growth at constant prices. This approach allows U.S.
price increases to be interpreted as real productivity gains.

One cannot help noticing that when analyzing and comparing economic
development across countries, the use of constant-price (real) comparisons
often leads to persistent contradictions. Yet despite this, the method
remains so deeply rooted that it has become a permanent methodological error
in economic literature. This is clearly linked to economic growth theories,
whose diversity and abundance do little to resolve these contradictions.
