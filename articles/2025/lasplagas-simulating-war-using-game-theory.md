A quick video on the [Colonel Blotto game](/tag/colonel-blotto-game/), which
visually introduces the [game](/tag/game-theory/) we have been posting about
recently. It implements a couple of straightforward strategies, which
gradually grow more sophisticated.

It seems that the "smart colonel" strategy from the video above is similar
to the strategy I have implemented to be used by computer opponent in the
app from [an earlier post]({filename}/articles/2024/colonel-blotto-game.md).
