Another summer has ended, and we are back to uncover and learn new things!
With the start of the new academic season, I want to dedicate more time to a
few research directions I have started but have not fully committed to. 

Sadly, this means less time for Physics of Risk. While I do have a list of
models and other curiosities to share with you (the readers of Physics of
Risk blog), the time I can reasonably allocate to the blog grows scarcer.
This year will be much slower in terms of the original and interactive
content.

Thank you for reading the blog, and I wish everyone a productive and
inspiring new academic year!
