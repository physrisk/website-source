Important thing to notice about [the poll-delayed voter
model]({filename}/articles/2025/poll-delayed-voter-model.md) is that it is a
second order auto-regressive process. In [cite id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"]
we have used this observation to derive an analytical expression for the
stationary variance for the model. To understand how this result came to
be, the following video by [ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath)
might prove useful.
