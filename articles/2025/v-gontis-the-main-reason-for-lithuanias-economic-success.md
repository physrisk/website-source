Assoc. Prof. Lesya Kolinets, lecturer in international macroeconomics at
VILNIUS TECH and professor at Ternopil National Economic University, and I
prepared a scientific manuscript [cite id="Kolinets2025"] on the economic
development of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries from 1995
to 2024. The results of this study may be of interest to a broad audience seeking to
gain a deeper understanding of the reasons behind Lithuania’s economic
success since regaining independence. Using relatively simple econometric
tools, we identify the key macroeconomic and financial components of CEE
economic growth, among which low private debt accumulation emerges as a
particularly significant factor.

Although the article has not yet been published in any economics journal, we
wish to share its findings with experts in Lithuania. Your thoughts,
criticisms, and suggestions could help to improve the paper and extend the
study in a broader context.

This brief overview, designed to capture readers' interest, is accompanied
by several figures that illustrate the results. The motivation of the
article stems from the desire to understand how Lithuania could rise from
tenth to first place among eleven CEE countries in the period from 1995 to
2030. Such a forecast is provided by the International Monetary Fund in its
World Economic Outlook (see Fig. 1).

"IMF data: ranking of CEE countries by GDP per capita in Purchasing Power
Parity (PPP) terms, 1995-2030.")

This forecast is far from arbitrary, since as of 2024, Lithuania's GDP level
is only slightly below that of the Czech Republic and Slovenia.  Comparison
with Latvia and Estonia is also essential, as all three Baltic states began
their development path from nearly identical historical, political, and
economic starting points.

to banks.")

In the second figure, it is evident that Lithuania’s economic leadership
among the Baltic states emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, as the
country had accumulated the lowest private indebtedness to banks in the
preceding period. This is no coincidence—our analysis confirms the same
finding within the broader set of CEE countries. To explore this, we employ
a time-varying coefficient linear regression of GDP growth on price level,
foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign trade, domestic capital investment,
government debt, private debt, and GDP level. These components shape GDP
dynamics in all countries in a similar qualitative way; only their
quantitative contribution differs. Figure 3 illustrates how the components
collectively contribute to the overall result for the Baltic states.

"Contribution of components to GDP per capita in the Baltic states. Total

level for each country.")

The pattern is very similar for other CEE countries: after 2008, the
absolute contribution of the price level, GDP, and private debt increases
markedly. A negative sign of contribution means that the component hinders
GDP growth. The strong positive relationship between the price level and
GDP corresponds to the Penn effect and the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis.
The negative contribution of the achieved GDP level is consistent with
classical growth theory. The contribution of the remaining components also
accords with previous economic studies. The particularly strong influence of
private debt is a novel finding of this research, one that deserves
attention in both practice and theory.

Emphasizing the exceptional role of private debt in the economic growth of
CEE countries, we also plotted its relative contribution compared to other
components (see Fig. 4).

"Relative contribution of private debt to the economic growth of CEE

manuscript.")

This illustration clearly demonstrates that the post-2008 economic growth of
CEE countries has been driven mainly by accumulated private debt. This
finding significantly contributes to explaining Lithuania’s macroeconomic
success and may be valuable for the further development of theories on
economic growth.
