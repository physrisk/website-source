Comparing the economic development of countries is not as straightforward as
it may seem to many. The most commonly used indicator—Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita or per employee—can vary significantly depending
on the currency used and how inflation in goods, services, and money is
accounted for. What complicates comparison most is that exchange rates
between currencies do not reflect differences in purchasing power across
the countries being compared.

To address this issue, the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) method has been
developed, which introduces a real exchange rate that accounts for price
level differences between countries. As a result, economic statistics
experts around the world generally agree that international comparisons of
economic development must be based on the PPP method.

However, we must acknowledge that in the public domain—including even in
widely recognized sources of economic information—other comparison methods
are often used. Most commonly, we see countries compared by real GDP,
adjusted to constant prices and expressed in a common currency. It should
come as no surprise that such comparisons often yield very different results
than those based on PPP.

In this brief overview of economic development in Central and Eastern Europe
(CEE), we rely on data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) World
Economic Outlook (WEO) database, using the PPP method. The selected period
spans 1995 to 2030, for which this data is available. Understandably,
figures from 2025 to 2030 are projections, but they are based on the best
available macroeconomic models and the observed development of each country
up to 2024.

Below, an interactive country comparison chart (hosted on [Flourish](https://flo.uri.sh/story/3197425/embed?auto=1#slide-0)) presents both the absolute
values of GDP per capita in international US dollars (click "Scores") and
the ranking of each country relative to others (click "Rank").

Both visualizations are highly valuable.

* The "Scores" view gives a compelling sense of how successfully CEE
  countries have integrated into the Western economic space: GDP growth
  reaches up to tenfold.
* There is no doubt that the new EU member states are rapidly converging
  with the old ones, confirming the economic success and benefits of the
  EU project for CEE countries.

Country-by-country comparison becomes even more dynamic when shown by
ranking in the "Rank" view. In this visualization, Lithuania advances
from the second-lowest position in 1995 to a projected leadership role by
2030. Had we included Southern European countries such as Italy, Spain,
Portugal, and Greece, it would become clear that Lithuania is expected
to lead even among them.

Although Lithuania still faces many unresolved social challenges, it can
rely on a strong economic foundation as it seeks the best available ways
to overcome them.
