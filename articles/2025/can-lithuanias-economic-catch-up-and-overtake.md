Can Lithuania catch up with and even overtake Western Europe? This question
is provocative—but not without foundation. A recent study [cite
id="Kolinets2025"] showed that Lithuania's economic progress stands out among
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Yet can this growth pace
enable it to reach the level of Malta and other Western economies?  Using
the same data and methodology, we compared the development of Malta and
Spain to identify which factors determine successful convergence.

Malta's example demonstrates that even small and open economies can achieve
remarkable progress and move toward the level of developed countries.
Meanwhile, Spain's convergence has stalled, revealing limited prospects for
faster growth. An analysis of these differences helps to assess the role
played by foreign direct investment (FDI), price levels, and government debt
dynamics.

The illustration shows the undeniable success of Malta, a small and open
economy that, over a relatively short period, has caught up with and even
surpassed several Western countries. During the same period, the older
economies appear largely stagnant, moving almost synchronously with global
economic and financial cycles. Malta's case appears inspiring and can serve
as a practical model of economic policy—one that confirms the feasibility of
not only catching up but also surpassing. Spain's chances of matching the
more developed countries appear limited; yet, comparing its macroeconomic
indicators with those of Malta helps reveal the main reasons for Malta's
success.

Figure 2 presents the changes in the price-level index (according to
Eurostat) for the selected countries. As expected, Malta's economic growth
has also been accompanied by a rise in prices, while fluctuations in U.S.
price levels suggest that the dollar's exchange rate and monetary policy
remain key sources of global economic volatility.

A notable observation is that countries whose convergence with the U.S. has
stagnated also exhibit stable price levels, with only minor fluctuations.

Data analysis shows that the economic growth of both CEE and Western and
Southern European countries depends heavily on accumulated FDI. Therefore,
Figure 3 shows the changes in Malta's and Spain's accumulated foreign direct
investment over the analyzed period.

The data clearly demonstrate that Malta's strong economic growth began
precisely when major foreign investment projects were completed. This growth
phase, which started around 2006, continues to this day and is one of the
few pronounced positive trends among the mature democracies. Spain's FDI has
also grown, but its pattern is typical for Western European economies.

Foreign trade is another crucial factor, especially for small economies.
Figure 4 shows that Malta's foreign trade expansion coincides with the surge
in FDI. It is worth noting that the trade volumes of other countries also
increase at rates similar to Spain's, while their absolute levels depend
primarily on the size of each economy.

A rather unexpected finding is that domestic capital investment follows an
almost identical trajectory across countries, regardless of their size or
macroeconomic conditions (see Figure 5). Even adding the group of CEE
countries would not significantly change the overall picture.

In our earlier study on CEE economies [cite id="Kolinets2025"], we
identified the exceptional role of private debt in cross-country
competition. We showed that the rapid growth of Lithuania, Poland, and
Romania can be linked to their exceptionally low levels of private debt.
Unfortunately, in Western Europe, there are no countries with similarly low
private indebtedness; in almost all of them, the level exceeds 100% of GDP,
and in some cases, even reaches or surpasses 200% of GDP (see Figure 6)

Countries.]({static}/uploads/2025/can-lithuanias-economic-catch-up-and-overtake-6.png
"Evolution of Private Debt in Western European Countries.")

In terms of private debt, neither Malta nor Spain stands out significantly;
however, both belong to the group of countries that managed to reduce
private debt levels after the 2008 crisis, while some others allowed it to
rise further.

Another key factor in the development of Western and Southern Europe is
central government debt. Within this group of countries, the range is from
40% to 150% of GDP (see Figure 7). Our research, along with other studies,
suggests that in mature European economies, government debt has a more
substantial impact on economic growth than private debt. This contrasts with
the CEE region calls for more detailed investigation and explanation.

After the crisis, Malta's government debt fell below 50% of GDP, whereas
Spain's (like that of several other countries) rose above 100% of GDP. It is
worth noting that all countries that substantially increased their public
debt have faced visible economic growth problems—only the United States has
been able, at least temporarily, to avoid them.

## Key Conclusions

* Malta has demonstrated outstanding economic growth, particularly following
  significant inflows of foreign direct investment. It is the only country
  that can clearly be seen as achieving rapid convergence with the United
  States during the analyzed period.
* Other Western European countries appear stagnant in comparison, though the
  overall gap with the U.S. remains relatively stable rather than widening.
* The dominant issue across Western economies is rising public and private
  debt. Despite the United States' even higher debt levels, its growth
  continues to set the benchmark for the global economy—likely due to the
  world's reliance on the U.S. dollar.
* Malta's experience demonstrates that, even among developed countries, it
  is possible to grow faster than its peers. Strong FDI inflows and prudent
  management of government debt have driven its success.
* Many CEE countries, including Lithuania, have a realistic chance of
  maintaining similar macroeconomic conditions and continuing to converge
  toward developed Western levels.

Lithuania, in particular, retains real potential to sustain rapid economic
growth similar to Malta's—provided it remains attractive to foreign
investment, it keeps both public and private debt at a low level. The
greatest challenge ahead is geopolitical instability, as well as the
sensitivity of external capital flows to regional tensions.
