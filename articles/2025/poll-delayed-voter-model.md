In the [yearly overview]({filename}/articles/2025/overview-of-2024.md), I
mentioned that I wanted to write a few posts about [cite
id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"]. The model introduced in [cite
id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"] is particularly interesting because it breaks
the core assumption of the [original voter
model]({filename}/articles/2016/voter-model.md). In the "poll-delayed voter
model" the [agents](/tag/agent-based-models/) do not interact directly with
each other. Instead, they become aware of the opinion distribution in
society through the periodic public polling.

Let us see what we can learn from this model.

## Model

The noisy voter model is driven by independent exploration of the opinion
space by the agents (switching event rate is given by \\\( \sigma\_i \\\)
where the index stands for the destination state) and by imitation of the
peers (switching event rate is proportional to parameter \\\( h \\\)). Total
birth (generation) and death (recombination) rates in respect to the number
of agents in state "1", \\\( X\\\), are given by:

\begin{equation}
\lambda\left(X\rightarrow X+1\right)=\lambda^{+}=\left(N-X\right)\left[\sigma\_{1}+h X\right],
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lambda\left(X\rightarrow X-1\right)=\lambda^{-}=X\left[\sigma\_{0}+h\left(N-X\right)\right].
\end{equation}

It is trivial to see that the imitation process can be aligned with the
reference clock. In other words, we can eliminate \\\( h \\\) by rescaling
time, \\\( t \rightarrow h t \\\). The rescaled independent transition rates
are then given by \\\( \varepsilon\_i = \frac{\sigma\_i}{h} \\\).

The total birth and death rates for the poll-delayed voter model take the
following form:

\begin{equation}
\lambda\_{k}^{+}=\left(N-X\right)\left[\varepsilon\_{1}+A\_{k-1}\right],
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lambda\_{k}^{-}=X\left[\varepsilon\_{0}+\left(N-A\_{k-1}\right)\right].
\end{equation}

The most important difference from the noisy voter model is that the
transition rates incorporate \\\(A\_k\\\) instead of \\\(X\\\). This
variable helps us denote incorporation of polling and delays. Let us define
it as:

\begin{equation}
A\_k = X \left( k \tau \right).
\end{equation}

In the above \\\( k \\\) would stand for the number of the poll, and \\\(
\tau \\\) is the polling period (which is also aligned with announcement
delays). In the real time, last revealed poll information is given by:

\begin{equation}
A\_{k-1} = A\_{-1} \left( t \right)
    = X \left( \left\lfloor \frac{t}{\tau} - 1 \right\rfloor \tau \right).
\end{equation}

The figure below, and the app even further down, serve as an illustration to
the logic behind the model. In both the red curve represents the evolution
of the system state, \\\( X \\\). The other curves represent data gathered
during the polls: the black curve show the most recently announced poll
result, \\\( A\_{k-1} \\\), while the gray curve indicates the most recent
poll outcome, \\\( A\_{k} \\\). It is important to stress that \\\( A\_{k-1}
\\\) is already public information, while \\\( A\_{k} \\\) is still being
processed by the pollster.  At the beginning of each polling period, at \\\(
t=k\tau \\\), the gray curve intersects both the red and black curves. This
indicates that the results of the latest poll are being made public, and the
new poll information is collected for processing.  Between the polls, the
red curve fluctuates, generally trending towards the black curve, reflecting
how the system state incorporates the most recent public information.

## Numerical simulation of the model

In general, the noisy voter model can be simulated using the Gillespie
method [cite id="Gillespie1977"]. Still, in this case, one would need to
modify it heavily [cite id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"]. Another concern is the
speed of the Gillespie method. For the poll-delayed voter model, it is just
too slow. Especially for the longer polling periods.

Hence, in [cite id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"], we have proposed an alternative
model, which makes use of the convenient observation that \\\( A\_{k-1} \\\)
remains constant in between the polls. Thus, there is little difference
between the independent exploration and peer imitation between the polls. We
can encompass both mechanisms within effective independent transition rates:

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon\_{1}^{\left(k\right)}=\varepsilon\_{1}+A\_{k-1},
    \quad\varepsilon\_{0}^{\left(k\right)}=\varepsilon\_{0}+\left(N-A\_{k-1}\right).
\end{equation}

Due to the effective transition rates, we can then consider single-agent
dynamics and find how the probability that the agent will switch to state
"1" depends on the polling period [cite id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"].
Actually the probability applies for any period, which does not go across
the polling period boundary. Thus, the transition probability over time
period \\\( \tau \\\), for an agent initially occupying state \\\( s\_0
\\\), is given by:

\begin{equation}
P\_{1}\left(\tau|s\_0\right)=P\_{1}\left(\infty\right)+\left[s\_0-P\_{1}\left(\infty\right)\right]\exp\left[-\left(\varepsilon\_{0}+\varepsilon\_{1}+N\right)\tau\right].
\end{equation}

In the above \\\( P\_{1}\left(\infty\right) \\\) is the stationary (long time
limit) probability, which is given by:

\begin{equation}
P\_{1}\left(\infty\right)=\frac{\varepsilon\_{1}^{\left(k\right)}}{\varepsilon\_{0}^{\left(k\right)}+\varepsilon\_{1}^{\left(k\right)}}=\frac{\varepsilon\_{1}+A\_{k-1}}{\varepsilon\_{0}+\varepsilon\_{1}+N}.
\end{equation}

Knowing this single-agent probability, we also know how whole system state
would change during an arbitrary time period \\\( \Delta t \\\) (as long as no poll
information is revealed during that time):

\begin{equation}
X\left(t+\Delta t\right)=B\left[X\left(t\right),P\_{1}\left(\Delta t|1\right)\right]+B\left[N-X\left(t\right),P\_{1}\left(\Delta t|0\right)\right].
\end{equation}

In the above \\\(B\left[N,p\right] \\\) stands for a sample from binomial
distribution with \\\( N \\\) trials and success probability \\\( p \\\).

Detailed description (and derivation) of the algorithm can be found in the
subsection 3.2 of [cite id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"]. Python implementation
of this algorithm can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/akononovicius/poll-delayed-noisy-voter-model/tree/main/macro_sim).

## Interactive app

This interactive app invites you to explore the model visually. Feel free to
play around with parameter values. I think the most interesting parameters
for this demonstration would be the initial conditions, \\\( X(0) \\\) and
\\\( A\_{-1} \\\). Having to specify two initial conditions is
consequence of the this model having delays. Observe that for larger
\\\( \tau \\\) periodic patterns emerge on their own, while for smaller
\\\( \tau \\\) they are dampened.

Note: "Â»" button will allow you to skip over \\\( 1000 \\\) polls quickly.
Use it to essentially forget the model's current state and possibly jump to
a mostly independent fragment of the time series generated by the model
using the same parameters.
