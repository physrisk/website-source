Happy New Year! It is time for our yearly reflection. Unexpectedly, we just
had another good year on Physics of Risk. At least content-wise. We have
published 36 posts (+3 in comparison to the [previous
year]({filename}/articles/2024/overview-2023.md)). Half of the posts, 18 in
total, were supplemented by [interactive
materials](/tag/interactive-models/). Overall trend remains more-or-less
stable as can be seen from the plot below. 

![Number of posts written in English and still available on this site as of
the end of 2024]({static}/uploads/2025/overview-of-2024.png "The number of
posts written in English and still available on this iteration of Physics of
Risk (as of the end of 2024). The wide bars represent total number of posts
for each year since 2010, while the narrower bars represent a number of
posts containing an interactive app.")

Exploring [random telegraph noise](/tag/random-telegraph-noise/) has led us
to explore some related topics in [statistics](/tag/statistics/). Namely, we
have shown that power-law distributions can be manufactured by using
mixtures of other distributions. Reviewer comments on our recent paper [cite
id="Kononovicius2024upoiss"] have prompted a quick look at the core concept
in statistical physics - [Fermi-Dirac
statistics](/tag/fermi-dirac-statistics/).

Summer vacation has served as a reset. I have restarted with a rant about
the state of open science, and general tutorial videos, but quickly switch
to a few unrelated topics in [statistics](/tag/statistics/) and [opinion
dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics/). Finally, we have started talking about
[Colonel Blotto game](/tag/colonel-blotto-game/), which we will continue
this year. I would also like to write a post or two about another recent
paper by me and coauthors from [Faculty of Mathematics and
Informatics](https://mif.vu.lt/en/) [cite id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"]. And
then... we will see what comes!
