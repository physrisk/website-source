After one of my first presentations at student's conference OpenReadings, I
received a comment along the lines of "it's just some fancy randomness".
Well, yes, but... Over the years I have seen lots of otherwise good students
who struggle with even most basic statistical concepts. So, being "fancy"
makes it reasonably hard. Furthermore, random processes underlie many
important everyday systems.

This [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium) video tells a
fascinating story about how a petty feud between two Russian mathematicians
led to the development of [Markov chain](/tag/markov-chains/) formalism.
