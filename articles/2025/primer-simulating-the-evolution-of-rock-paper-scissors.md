Over the last few months, we have focused on the [game
theory](/tag/game-theory/). We have recently even looked at adaptive
strategies in repeated [Colonel Blotto
games]({filename}/articles/2025/adaptive-strategy-colonel-blotto-game.md).
Another approach to adaptation phenomena is evolutionary game theory. Video
by [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/@PrimerBlobs) is an excellent
illustration of this fascinating branch of [game theory](/tag/game-theory/).
So, let us see how the players' strategies evolve when playing the classic
"rock, paper, scissors" game. Players will play the game multiple times and
learn from their experience. Though notably, here, learning will be
indirect. Instead of individual, the simulated society will evolve based on
the performance of different strategies. Can you guess the evolutionary
trajectory of the simulated society?
