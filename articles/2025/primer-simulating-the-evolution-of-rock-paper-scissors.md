While on the topic of [game theory](/tag/game-theory/), let us take a look
at an example of the evolutionary [game theory](/tag/game-theory/). Let us
see how the players evolve when playing an arguably simpler game ("rock,
paper, scissors"), but doing so multiple times and learning from their
experience. Though, notably, learning is indirect - instead simulated
society evolves. Can you guess its evolutionary trajectory?
