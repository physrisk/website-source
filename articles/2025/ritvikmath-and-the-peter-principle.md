Another interesting video by
[ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath) explains why workplace
incompetence is so prevalent. In the 1960s dr. Laurence J. Peter had
observed that "in a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to their level
of incompetence." Originally, the observation was intended as a satire, but
since then it has become an object for scientific debate.

To me explanation sound overly simplistic, but do think that the principle
still holds. I have met people who have worked hard for promotion (diploma,
certification, etc.), just to "relax" right after obtaining it.

From scientific point of view debate surrounding this principle reminds be
the discussions about the [hot hand](/tag/hot-hand/) phenomenon. Although,
the Peter principle seems to be more related to the [game
theory](/tag/game-theory/) rather than [statistics](/tag/statistics/).
