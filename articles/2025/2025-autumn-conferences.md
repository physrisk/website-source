Over the last few weeks we, [I](/tag/a-kononovicius/) and
[Rytis](/tag/r-kazakevicius/), have attended two conferences. One, [Polish
symposium](https://fens25.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/), in Warsaw and the other,
[Lithuanian conference](https://lnfk.ktu.edu/), in Kaunas.

Symposium on Physics in Economics and Social Sciences.")

The [Polish symposium](https://fens25.fizyka.pw.edu.pl/) was particularly
interesting to me, because I got to see the directions in which Econophysics
and Sociophysics are developing. We had a chance to hear about fractal
complex networks, correlation dynamics in cryptocurrency markets, limit
order book modeling (with presenters from Finnish and German institutions)
and applications of [agent-based modeling](/tag/agent-based-models/) to
variety of problems.

The [Lithuanian conference](https://lnfk.ktu.edu/) allowed us to see what is
being done here in Lithuania, and by Lithuanian scientists abroad.

We have also presented our recent advances. Both of my presentations (one
talk and one poster) were about the same thing - the [poll-delayed voter
model](/tag/poll-delayed-voter-model/) [cite id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"].
While [Rytis](/tag/r-kazakevicius/) talked about our work on scaled voter
model [cite id="Kazakevicius2023PRE"] (sadly, it might be too complicated
for Physics of Risk) and about a brand new topic on stochastic diffusion he
is developing together with one of his student.
