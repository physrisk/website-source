In this [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile) video prof.
Marcus du Sautoy talks about mathematics behind the [board
game](/tag/board-games/) he likes to play with his kids. What a better way
to spend winter holidays, than playing [board games](/tag/board-games/)?
Watch the video not only to gain competitive edge, but also to see how
serious mathematics (and physics) can be applied to a fun casual activity.
