In October 2021, [South American Institute of Fundamental Research of
International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp-saifr.org)
hosted a workshop on Sociophysics. If you're looking to get started in doing
[opinion dynamics](/tag/opinion-dynamics/), this recording of the talks by
the two leading researchers in the field, Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron and Maxi
San Miguel, is a great place to begin. If you are interested, complete
program and recordings of other talks are available on dedicated
