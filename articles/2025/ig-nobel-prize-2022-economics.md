[Last time]({filename}/articles/2025/peter-principle.md) we have discussed a
model, which shows that random promotions can be the best way to ensure
efficiency of your organization. In the post we have mentioned that the
research has won [the Ig Nobel Management Prize in
2010](https://improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2010). Did you know that the same
group received [the Ig Nobel Economics Prize in
2022](https://improbable.com/ig/winners/#ig2022)? Furthermore, they received
the prize for the model we have already covered on [Physics of
Risk](/tag/talent-vs-luck/). We encourage you to watch their acceptance
speech below.
