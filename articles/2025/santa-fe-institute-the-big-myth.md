From time to time I enjoy catching up to the seminars hosted by the [Santa
Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) and shared on [their Youtube
page](https://www.youtube.com/@SFIScience). In this seminar Naomi Oreskes
(from Harvard University) discusses her recent book (written together with
Erik M. Conway) titled "The Big Myth: How American Business Taught Us to
Loathe Government and Love the Free Market". This seminar (and the book, I
guess) dives into the historical context of how [free
market](/tag/free-market/) fundamentalism became dominant
[economic](/tag/economics) ideology in the US and the western world, in
general.

For me key points of the talk were that Adam Smith, who pseudo-economists in
Lithuania like to paint as [free market](/tag/free-market/) saint, was on a
big fan of the "invisible hand". He wrote that regulation might be warranted
when the "natural liberty of a few individuals endangers the security of the
whole society". Providing a regulatory advice on dealing with reckless
banking practices of his own time:

> The obligation of building [fire] walls, in order to prevent the
> communication of fire, is a violation of natural liberty exactly of the
> same kind with the regulations of the banking trade which are here
> proposed.

A few more comments clarifying Adam Smith's relationship with the [free
market](/tag/free-market/) ideology can be found in this
