[Last week]({filename}/articles/2019/mark-diff-model.md) we have talked about
what drives formation of social groups. We have understood that people both want
to belong to some group and also want to feel special. Having many different
social groups is natural, but also dangerous as the need the groups need to feel
safe and somewhat superior to the other groups. These needs might be manipulated
to give rise to a social [conflict](/tag/conflicts) or war.

Another theory claims that social [conflicts](/tag/conflicts) or
wars might be driven by the greed, will to obtain some resource.
This type of conflicts were modeled by Sebastian Schutte of International
Conflict Research Group at ETH Zurich. While his work is built upon something
similar to regression models, his insights are nevertheless valuable in the
context of Physics of Risk. We invite you to watch the videos below.
