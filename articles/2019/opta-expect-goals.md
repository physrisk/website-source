How often football commentators say something along the lines "striker has to
score from here", "it was an easy stop for goalkeeper" or "it was an excellent
opportunity"? How many times have you cursed, because your favorite team missed
an obvious chance to take the lead? In a tense game, both we (the fans) and the
commentators tend to give the way to emotions and leave rational thinking on the
bench. Yet with the modern technology and understanding of statistics it is
quite possible to calculate odds of scoring a goal in a particular situation.

Watch this video by Opta in which their metric
"expected goals" is explained. Though it is not very detailed explanation, but
it could spark your own imagination.
