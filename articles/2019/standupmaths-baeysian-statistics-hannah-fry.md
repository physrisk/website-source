Another interesting math video by Matt Parker, who this time talks to Hannah
Fry about the historical origins of Bayesian statistics. Most of the videos
time is devoted to replicating thought experiment proposed by Bayes, which
highlights essential concepts underlying modern understanding of the Bayesian
statistics. We invite you to be bayesian person!
