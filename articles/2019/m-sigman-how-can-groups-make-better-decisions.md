Recently we have introduced you all to the
[hierarchical voting model]({filename}/articles/2018/hierarchical-voting-model.md)
by Serge Galam. Now let us consider a very similar idea - what if before voting
the people would discuss the issue in question in the small groups? Experiments
conducted by social scientists Mariano Sigman and Dan Ariely seem to indicate
that such procedure allows for crowds to become a bit wiser. Watch the following
TED video in which Mariano Sigman describes both the concept and its
implementation as experiment.
