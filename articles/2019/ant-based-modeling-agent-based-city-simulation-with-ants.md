Significant portion of our works in the last decade are based on the
[Kirman model](/tag/kirman-model/), which itself is inspired by the behavior of
social insects. Experiments which inspired Kirman to formulate his agent-based
model actually used ant colonies as their observation object (recall our first
post on the [Kirman model]({filename}/articles/2010/kirman-ants.md)). Now it
appears that scientists at [MIT](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/ant-based-modeling/overview/)
are doing the opposite - using ants as a living agent-based model.
