A player sinks his fourth shot in a row and the crowd goes wild, while
commentators say what the crowd is thinking the magic phrase "he is on fire!"
But is he? There is a significant body of literature related to the hot hand in
sports. Some of the papers claim that they have found the effect, while the
others try to disprove it.<!--more-->

Recently we have also added our own insights into this problem
[cite id="Kononovicius2019NBA"] by replying to another paper in which the
existence of hot streaks in NBA team winning records was shown by using
[DFA technique]({filename}/articles/2011/multifractality-time-series.md)
[cite id="Ferreira2018PhysA"]. We have shown that the authors have slightly
over estimated Hurst exponents, which could indicate presence of hot/cold
streaks. We have also shown that the corrected Hurst exponents, although
indicating the presence of streaks, are still quite consistent with purely
random models. Similar approach can be used for individual performance as well.

The main idea in disproving hot hand is to shuffle the studied series. Obviously
shuffling should destroy any presence of streaks. If the shuffled time series
still have the same statistical properties as original time series, then those
statistical properties can't be used as evidence for the hot hand (hot streak)
phenomenon. See the detailed explanation of such approach in the Numberphile
video below.
