It is often said that turning up to vote is not quite rational behavior, because
the probability that your vote would decided the outcome is minuscule. Opponents
of such outlook say that it is rational to vote, because you might want to show
support for the political system (democracy) or to avoid the regret.

I guess at least one person in Byron-Bethany irrigation district in California
feels such regret, because the last election outcome in this district was
decided by three random rolls of the twenty sided dice. More details in the CBS
video below.
