We have been talking about different models of opinion dynamics, but we have
never mentioned that electoral system can distort the actual opinions of the
populace. In some cases electoral system can be rigged to favor one of the
competing parties. One of such example is found in the United States.

In the US boundaries of electoral districts play a major role, because during
the elections there it does not matter how many votes are cast for each of the
parties. Only who ``won'' that district matters. So you can actually noticeably
influence the election outcome by drawing electoral boundaries in a smart way.

More details about gerrymandering in the following video by Above the Noise. We
invite you to watch it.
