This year I got to teach a numerical methods course to first year students in
Faculty of Physics (Vilnius University). As theory is somewhat boring and
feels somewhat detached from practice, I have decided to provide students with
practical showcase on how to work with empirical data. For this showcase I have
selected a small subset of [a larger football data set](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata).
Namely, I decided to take a look at English Premier League's 2000/2001 season.<!--more-->

This showcase took two lectures and a bit of time after the lectures to cleanup
the code. The first lecture was mostly dedicated to empirical analysis of the
data set, while the second lecture's focus was building a statistical model based
on the analysis.

## Empirical analysis

**What was the highest scoring games during the analyzed season?** We have
asked this question out of simple curiosity as well as to check whether our
understanding of the data is good enough to do more complex analysis. Our
findings were identical to the ones reported in official statistics, so we
can assume that everything works fine to this point.

**Is there evidence for a home advantage?** This rather interesting question
as beliefs about home advantage are as common as beliefs about "hot hands" we
have written about [earlier]({filename}/articles/2019/hot-hand-fallacy.md).
Interestingly unlike for the "hot hands" we clearly see that home teams gain
noticeable advantage against their opponents.

League 2000/2001 season playing home and away.")

**Is there a difference between number of goals scored home and away?** This
question is mostly related to the previous one. Here we see that usually teams
scored more goals home than away, though there are few exceptions. All of the
major exceptions were stuck in the bottom of table during the season. So I guess
if you are terrible, then you are equally terrible at home and away.

**Is there a difference between teams performance in the first half of a season
and the second half of a season?** Obviously there can be changes in team form
on this time scale. These might be related to squad or managerial changes. Also
there could some variance of purely statistical nature. While we have found some
noticeable differences we can't make any conclusions without deeper knowledge
of transfers and injuries throughout the season.

--- First / Second Half of the season ---
          Arsenal 30 33 0.909
      Aston Villa 23 23 1.000
    Bradford City 13 17 0.765

## Statistical model

Statistical model we have built based on the observations is quite similar to
the one discussed by prof. Tony Padilla in the Numberphile video we have linked
below. You can watch the idea to get a general idea, or review our formulas
further below the video.

So initially we take a look at the league as whole. Namely we figure out baseline
goal scoring capacities for all teams in the Premier League. As we know that
goal scoring capacities are different for home and away teams, we calculate them
separately:

\begin{equation}
    \langle \lambda\_{HG} \rangle = \frac{\Sigma\_{HG}}{380} , \qquad
    \langle \lambda\_{AG} \rangle = \frac{\Sigma\_{AG}}{380} .
\end{equation}

In the above \\\( \lambda\_{HG} \\\) is the home team goal scoring capacity, which
is calculated by dividing total goals scored by the home teams by the number
of games. Away team goal scoring capacity, \\\( \lambda\_{AG} \\\), is calculated in
similar manner.

Then we treat teams separately by considering their relative attacking and
defensive potentials both home and away. So all in all we get four distinct
numbers for each of the team. These are obtained once again by dividing goals
(scored and conceded by the team home and away, divided by the number of games).
So team attack and defense potentials, if the team plays home, is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Att}\_{H,i} = \frac{1}{\langle \lambda\_{HG} \rangle} \cdot \frac{\Sigma\_{HG,i}}{19} , \qquad
    \mathrm{Def}\_{H,i} = \frac{1}{\langle \lambda\_{AG} \rangle} \cdot \frac{\Sigma\_{AG,-i}}{19} ,
\end{equation}

and if the team plays away:

\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Att}\_{A,i} = \frac{1}{\langle \lambda\_{AG} \rangle} \cdot \frac{\Sigma\_{AG,i}}{19} , \qquad
    \mathrm{Def}\_{A,i} = \frac{1}{\langle \lambda\_{HG} \rangle} \cdot \frac{\Sigma\_{HG,-i}}{19} .
\end{equation}

In the above \\\( \Sigma\_{HG,i} \\\) and \\\( \Sigma\_{AG,i} \\\) are the total number of
home and away goals for team \\\( i \\\), while \\\( \Sigma\_{HG,-i} \\\) and
\\\( \Sigma\_{AG,-i} \\\) are the total number of home and away goals against team
\\\( i \\\).

So when we generate a single game we can simply sample from Poisson distribution
to get total number of goals scored by home team, lets say \\\( i \\\), and away team,
lets say \\\( j \\\):

\begin{equation}
    g\_{h,i} \sim \mathrm{Poiss}(\langle \lambda\_{HG} \rangle \cdot \mathrm{Att}\_{H,i} \cdot \mathrm{Def}\_{A,j}) ,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    g\_{a,j} \sim \mathrm{Poiss}(\langle \lambda\_{AG} \rangle \cdot \mathrm{Att}\_{A,j} \cdot \mathrm{Def}\_{H,i}) .
\end{equation}

You might be wondering why we use Poisson distribution. We do so because we
assume that goal scoring is a random process (similar to radioactive decay and
such). Namely we assume that time between goals is exponential distributed.
This assumption appears to be rather fake, but this is indeed true for the
empirical data [cite id="Levene2019"]. Though we can't see this directly in the
considered data set, alternatively we could check directly the distribution of
goals in a game, but this thought came rather late and we haven't done this
during the lecture as we were running out of time.

## Matlab's scripts

I have made the Matlab (actually developed in GNU Octave, but the code should
be compatible with Matlab) code available on GitHub:
