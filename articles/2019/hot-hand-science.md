As we have seen [few weeks ago]({filename}/articles/2019/hot-hand-fallacy.md) there is no
evidence for hot hands in sports. While there is skill in sports, but short
term streaks do not exist. Their simply an illusion caused by the randomness
involved.

There is obviously skill in science. Yet numerous studies (e.g.
[cite id="Sinatra2016Science"]) have concluded an interesting thing - the
performance among scientists
is mostly random. A scientist could produce his best work at any stage of his
carrier. Yet the modern science financing schemes reward ones who produce their
best works early. Such schemes kick off rich-gets-richer effects. Small number
of groups start to get disproportionaly large share of finances in comparison
to their as capable colleagues, only because they were lucky enough to produce
their best works early.

This unfairness leads to suggestions on how to improve financing schemes. One
of the interesting suggestion is based on a lottery [cite id="Fang2016ASM"].
Namely, the experts evaluate
which research projects have sound plans and ideas. The ones who pass the
threshold enter the lottery. Why this would be better than simply awarding the
best? Because if the winners would always take all every time, this would kill
off a reasonable competition and the winners would no longer need to do their
best. While also because the experts are often quite subjective and this might
play a major role if competition is large.

Is there skill in acting? Most likely yes. Yet unlike in the previously
discussed cases the success in Hollywood is not random. It was shown that
[cite id="Williams2019"] we
can build statistical models, which can reasonably predict the actors peek
performance, because social network (not Facebook or Twitter, but the people
the actor knows) effects matters quite a lot. Getting along well with other
co-stars or director might find you the next job.
