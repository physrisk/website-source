We used to have more java applets dedicated to fractals before we have made
transition to HTML5 technology. Sadly we haven't yet updated some of them to
HTML5. One of the best looking applets, Mandelbrot Set applet, is still among
those to be "updated". So this time we suggest an interesting video about this
fractal set by Numberphile.
