It appears that people are even more terrible at randomness than computers.
Usually human ``randomness'' is too uniform. In the following video by
Numberphile Simon Pampena has put forward an interesting task for Brady -
to write down a series of 20 coin flips. The series wasn't as random as one
would reasonably expect. Watch the following video to gain some insights into
randomness.

Recall our discussion on the "hot hand phenomenon" earlier
(see [here]({filename}/articles/2019/hot-hand-fallacy.md) and
[here]({filename}/articles/2019/hot-hand-science.md))? We believe that this
might be at least tangently related. Both of these observation could be
explained a simple fact that we as humans want to see patterns everywhere.
We think that the world has to make sense, it simply can't be random. If we see
longer streak of successes we believe that it is not random, though as we have
now seen streaks of success indeed can be random.
