Here we continue our discussion on the Talent vs Luck model proposed by
[cite id="Pluchino2018ACS"]. This time we show you the reason why this model
is worthy of comparison to the [kinetic exchange models](/tag/kinetic-models/).
This model is capable of reproducing power-law wealth (capital in this model)
distribution.

Feel free to explore a new app, which is essentially identical to the one from
[the original post]({filename}/articles/2019/talent-vs-luck-model.md). It just
shows three different plots.

In the top right we now can see wealth distribution (its PDF) on double
logarithmic. Given enough time we will see straight line there, which indicates
that wealth distribution is power-law. On the bottom row we have on figure
talent distribution (it remains fixed through out the simulation) as well as
relative luck distribution (which appears to be close to being normally
distributed).
