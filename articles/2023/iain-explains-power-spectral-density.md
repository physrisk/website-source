Over the last few posts we have been talking about the [power spectral
density](/tag/spectral-density/) of different random processes. We have used
the fact that it is a modulus of the signal's [Fourier
transform](/tag/fourier-transform/) squared. But what is the meaning of the
[power spectral density](/tag/spectral-density/)?  Watch the video by "[Iain
Explains](https://www.youtube.com/@iain_explains)" below for some intuition.
