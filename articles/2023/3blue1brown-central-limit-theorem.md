[Central Limit Theorem](/tag/central-limit-theorem/) is one of the more
important concepts in [statistics](/tag/statistics/). To put it simply: it
explains why that many random processes exhibit normal distribution. Nice
visual exploration of this theorem was recently done by
[3Blue1Brown](/tag/3blue1brown/). We invite you to watch if you're not yet
familiar with the CLT.
