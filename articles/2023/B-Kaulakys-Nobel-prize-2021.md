A member of our research group gave a talk on Nobel prize awarded in 2021 at
[45th Lithuanian National Physics Conference](https://www.ff.vu.lt/lnfk-45).
Habil. dr. [B. Kaulakys](/tag/b-kaulakys/) talked about the research for
which the prize was awarded and how this research relates to works by
Lithuanian physicists (mostly our group) and mathematicians. We invite you
to watch it, but note that the recording is in Lithuanian. The slides, also
in Lithuanian, are available
