On the second day of Christmas we invite to watch a seminar given by prof.
[David Sumpter](https://www.david-sumpter.com/),
who is likely most well-known due to his work on football
analytics. In this seminar he gives semi-historical overview of topics more
than relevant to the scope of our blog. We invite you to watch it!
