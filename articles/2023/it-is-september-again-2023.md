Over the summer I (Aleksejus) was contacted by some people from MathWorks
who have seen [my rant (post) about
Matlab]({filename}/articles/2023/wont-be-teaching-matlab.md). I got kindly
asked if I could provide a more detailed feedback. Sadly (or happily?) I
have already forgot most of my experience with [Matlab](/tag/matlab/). There
are lots of memes about [Matlab](/tag/matlab/) online, so I guess I am not
the only one with similar experience. To be fair, I think one of the issues
is that a lot of Matlab handbooks are quite dated. Not in a sense that there
are
no new handbooks, but in a sense that the authors of many of even newer
handbooks are not that well familiar with newest best practices in Matlab.

Also just few days ago we got "rug pulled" by our local network admins.
Physics of Risk site went down due to local network configuration changes.
When we noticed the issue, and inquired about it, we got a reply a long the
lines of "Sorry. Made some changes. Yesterday." Now the changes are
temporarily reversed, but... we have already relocated Physics of Risk to
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). As we already store our source
code on GitHub (see [here](https://github.com/physrisk)), so why not?

Otherwise, the summer this year was not that eventful. So, Physics of Risk
will be back with a new post on Tuesday! And afterwards we will continue
talking about the [point processes](/tag/point-process/).
