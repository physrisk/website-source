I like Beta distribution, as it arises from my favorite model - [voter
model](/tag/voter-model/) (and [Kirman model](/tag/kirman-model/) due to
their similarity). There are other, arguably more important, reasons to like
it. These are discussed in another excellent [statistics](/tag/statistics/)
video by [ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/@ritvikmath).
