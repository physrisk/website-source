Over the last few weeks I had an opportunity to give a tutorial on
[agent-based modeling](/tag/agent-based-models/) in sociophysics. I have
made an attempt to showcase basic concepts and models related to the field.
The slides might be of interest to the Lithuanian readers of Physics of Risk
blog. You can download them by
