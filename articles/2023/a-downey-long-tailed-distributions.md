[Prof. Allen Downey](https://www.allendowney.com/) has written quite a few
books I have enjoyed reading ("Think Java", "Think Stats", "Think Bayes" and
"Think Complexity" to name a few). In this talk at
[SciPy](https://www.youtube.com/@SciPy-Conf) 2023 conference he gives an
excellent introduction into the long-tailed distributions. I invite you to
watch it!
