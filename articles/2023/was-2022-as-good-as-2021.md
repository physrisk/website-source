Well, at least it was as productive on Physics of Risk blog. Though with
less focus with quite a few assorted posts. In a few a bit longer series of
posts we have taken a look at three papers I have found interesting. [cite
id="Krapivsky2020JStat"] inspired few posts on [traffic](/tag/traffic/).
[cite id="Krapivsky2022Birds"] inspired couple posts on
[biology](/tag/biology/). Exploration of [cite id="Olmeda2022Dating"]
continues in series of posts on [dating apps](/tag/dating-apps-series/).

![Number of posts written in English and still available on this site]({static}/uploads/2023/was-2022-as-good-as-2021.png "The
number of posts written in English and still available on this iteration of Physics
of Risk. The wide bars represent total number of posts for each year since 2010,
while the narrower bars represent a number of posts with 'Interactive models' tag.")

Once again, at the time of writing this post, I still do not have an idea
what we will have in store for 2023. Obviously, we will finish
[dating apps](/tag/dating-apps-series/) series. And then we will have a few
more assorted posts?
