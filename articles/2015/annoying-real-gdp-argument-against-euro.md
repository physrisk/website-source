Though Paul Krugman is among the most
prominent critics of the Euro idea
\[[1](https://archive.nytimes.com/krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/annoying-euro-apologetics/)\],
there are many other professional economists and journalists criticizing
the macroeconomic policy of Euro zone. The problem of Greece has become
one of the most disputable because there is permanent pressure of
opinions ranging from a flat denial of Euro project to the
uncompromising critics of all steps in the process of its
implementation. "Realize," the main problem of the European development
arises from the bad idea and implementation of common currency and the
whole EU project gets stuck on this idea.

It is not our task to discuss possible geopolitical circumstances of
such purposeful opinion flow; we just want to draw attention that very
often these opinions are based on the fault argument. There is a flow of
new articles
\[[2](https://marketmonetarist.com/2015/07/14/the-euro-a-monetary-strangulation-mechanism/),[3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/07/23/finland-is-the-poster-child-for-why-the-euro-doesnt-work/)\]
making a comparison of real GDP growth of European countries already in
Euro area or pegged to Euro with countries still having floating
currency policies. There is no necessity to be an expert of
international macroeconomics to comprehend the relation between monetary
policy and real GDP growth. Floating currencies force to adjust local
level of prices to the new exchange rates shifting division between
inflationary part of GDP (deflator) and real GDP. This makes real GDP
dependent on local currency fluctuations and less appropriate for
economic growth comparisons between countries. This problem is well
understood by
[statisticians](https://www.worldbank.org/depweb/beyond/beyondco/beg_02.pdf)
of economic growth and GDP alternatively is calculated in purchasing
power parities PPP, where price level is discounted when measured in
common units (currency).

It is hard to imagine, that P. Krugman does not know these limits for
use of real GDP, nevertheless, he and very many his followers build
their macroeconomic arguments and compare performance of countries based
on this very limited GDP measure. Lets take more careful look at data
provided by recent authors
\[[2](https://marketmonetarist.com/2015/07/14/the-euro-a-monetary-strangulation-mechanism/),[3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/23/finland-is-the-poster-child-for-why-the-euro-doesnt-work/)\].
Lars Christensen has published his
[comments](https://marketmonetarist.com/2015/07/14/the-euro-a-monetary-strangulation-mechanism/)
on real GDP growth data in Europe for the period 2007-2014. For your
convenience we just repeat Lars’s figure:

Christensen."){#attachment_2818} 

Lets compare with next figure, making correct comparison of economic
growth in Europe, where GDPs are measured in purchasing power standards
([EuroStat
data](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-datasets/-/tec00114)).
The imagined advantage of floaters obviously disappears together with
all arguments revealing Euro strangulation force. One can easily check
these results for various time periods, at least starting from 1995 as
EuroStat gives us. Our general conclusion is that GDP growth data of
European countries do not provide statistical evidence of advantage for
any of these monetary choices. There is some tendency that floating
currencies work better in short time period and pegged currencies work
better in long time period. There is strong evidence that Baltic
countries with their pegged currencies are more successful than Vysegrad
countries with their floating currencies caching up developed European
countries

The article published by Matt O’Brien in The Washington Post
\[[3](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/23/finland-is-the-poster-child-for-why-the-euro-doesnt-work/)\]
is a nice piece of very convincing text promoting ideas of the new
monetary ideology
\[[5](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2013/07/26/the-new-monetary-ideology)\].
The problem is that with incorrect quantitative arguments one is able to
please the ideology but cannot serve the truth. Lets compare the
figures. First we provide comparison of Sweden and Finland given in The
Washington Post by Matt.

GDP]({static}/uploads/2015/SweedenFinlandComparisonThWP.png "Comparison of
GDP percentage change between Finland and Sweden starting from
1989."){#attachment_2820} 

Though there is no direct statement that comparison is made in real GDP,
one can easily figure out it by comparing with our figure, where
percentage change of GDP calculated in current international dollars
([PPP data from World
Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD)) in the
period from 1990 is given. This data proves that long-term recovery of
Finland is much stronger than of Sweden. The current problem of Finland
related with Nokia just needs the time to be solved in the long-term
macroeconomic level.

These and other cases, when prominent authors and Media use fault
argument of real GDP growth already have become really annoying for
those, who still rely on statistical data as a source of information on
economic growth. Nevertheless, lets compare the growth of Euro zone and
US for the more complete picture of this annoying problem.
