In our works we frequently
refer to bounded rationality and of human beings. This boundedness
causes varying inefficiencies in socio-economic systems. These
inefficiencies, or bugs, are not just some strange quirk in the system.
These bugs often play major role in forming socio-economic systems as
they are observed.

This notion is not new in economics as it has its own branch known as
behavioral economics (or behavioral finance). Dan Ariely is one of
economists who are interested in human brain bugs on individual and
global level. In his talk, recorded for
[ted.com](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_on_our_buggy_moral_code),
he develops one of the aspects behind behavioral economics - human
tendency to tell small lies and bypass their own moral code.
