Numerous
tabletop, card and role-playing game projects are launched on
crowd-funding platform Kickstarter each week. Some of these projects do
well, while others fail to muster support. Recently we have noticed
interesting project by Dan Ariely, whose [TED talk we have shared
earlier](/d-ariely-on-our-buggy-moral-code),
and Irrational Ventures named "Irrational Card Game." This game, as a
tabletop game, might not be the most interesting, but it is certainly
interesting as a tool to bring social science to the masses. First of
all, cards in this game are filled with information about social
experiments and their outcomes. Also neat feature of this game is that
by supporting it, you support actual scientific research.
