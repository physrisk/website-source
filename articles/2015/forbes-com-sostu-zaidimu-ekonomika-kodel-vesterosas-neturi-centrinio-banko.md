Central
bank is economical institution, which is seen as essential part of the
contemporary economics. One of its many functions includes
implementation of the monetary policy - namely regulating amount of
money circulating in the market (i.e., printing of money). Most commonly
it is said that first contemporary central banks emerged by the end of
XVII century (starting from England), though there were attempts at
creating something similar during the middle ages.

they do.
