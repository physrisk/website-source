Gontis, currently working in Boston, was invited to give a talk to a
students of [Boston Lithuanian School](http://www.blsm.org/). Though
slides are based [on the previous
talk](/cafe-scientifique-rizikos-fizika-kuo-daugiau-fizikos-tuo-maziau-rizikos-vaizdo-irasas "Cafe Scientifique “Physics of Risk: the more physics, the less risk” video recording"),
but the narrative is completely new and aimed at younger viewer (though
once again it was given in Lithuanian).
