Gontis, currently working in Boston, was invited to give a talk to a
students of Boston Lithuanian School. Though
slides are based [on the previous
talk]({filename}/articles/2013/cafe-scientifique-physics-of-risk-more-physics-less-risk-video.md),
but the narrative is completely new and aimed at younger viewer (though
once again it was given in Lithuanian).
