Economic inequality is
becoming a forgotten topic, but there are much more to be said about it.
In this talk, recorded for
[ted.com](https://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson) website, Richard
Wilkinson provides a lot of examples (based on empirical data), which
show how large inequality harms human societies. In order to create a
better world for all of us, we should strive for larger economic
equality.
