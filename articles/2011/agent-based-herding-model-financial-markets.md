Kirman's ant colony model, previously
presented on our website as [agent
based]({filename}/articles/2010/kirman-ants.md)
(based on \[cite id="Kirman1993QJE"\]) and
[stochastic]({filename}/articles/2010/stochastic-ant-colony-model.md)
(based on \[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco, Alfarano2008Dyncon"\]) model,
has become classical example of herding modeling. Application of this
model towards economic, financial or other social scenarios might seem
doubtful as human society is far more complex than ant colony, but
methodologically it is more useful to start from very simple and
stylized model and later add complexity on top of it. Furthermore we
have already shown that Kirman's herding dynamics could be applicable in
agent-based marketing (see [comparison of Kirman's and Bass diffusion
model]({filename}/articles/2011/unidirectional-kirman-model.md)).
In this text we will consider financial market scenario and obtain
stochastic differential equations similar to the existing stochastic
models considered in \[cite id="Reimann2011PhysA,
Ruseckas2010PhysRevE"\].<!--more-->

Discussion and model presented in this text is the main topic of our
paper on *Microscopic reasoning for the non-linear stochastic models of
long-range memory* \[cite id="Kononovicius2012PhysA"\].

Introduction of variable event time scale
-----------------------------------------

Original Kirman's model assumes constant agent meeting rate. In
financial market scenario one could draw analogy between these events
and trades, as trade is pair-wise interaction of traders, or agents in
model's case, and also a great opportunity to reconsider available
options. Thus we rewrite original one-step transition probabilities as

\begin{equation}
 p(X \rightarrow X+1)=(N-X) \left\[\sigma\_1 + \frac{hX}{\tau(X)} \right\] \Delta t , 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 p(X \rightarrow X-1)=X \frac{\sigma\_2 + h (N-X)}{\tau(X)}\Delta t , 
\end{equation}

where \\\(  \tau(X) \\\) is characteristic inter-event time, which now
depends on system state. Note that in the above transition probabilities
we have already assumed that one group of agent is rational, \\\( N-X \\\), while another is not, \\\(  X \\\). For this reason transition
rate, \\\(  \sigma\_1 \\\), of \\\(  N-X \\\) has remained constant.

In this, more general, case derivation of stochastic differential
equation in the manner it was done in \[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco"\]
(also discussed on our
[website]({filename}/articles/2010/stochastic-ant-colony-model.md))
is rather troublesome. Though alternatively we can use one-step process
formalism \[cite id="Alfarano2008Dyncon, VanKampen2007NorthHolland"\].
In such case we compactly express Master equation using one-step
operators, \\\(  \boldsymbol{E} \\\) and \\\(  \boldsymbol{E}^{-1} \\\):

\begin{equation}
 \partial\_t \omega(x,t) = N^2 \left\\\{ (\boldsymbol{E} -1)\[ \pi^{-}(x) \omega(x,t) \] + (\boldsymbol{E}^{-1} -1) \[\pi^{+}(x) \omega(x,t) \] \right\\\} , \label{master}
\end{equation}

where \\\(  \pi^{\pm}(x)  \\\) are probability fluxes related to
the transitions probabilities as \\\(  P(X \rightarrow X \pm 1)=N^2 \pi^{\pm}(x) \Delta t  \\\). Evidently \\\(  x \\\) is
continuous system state variable, defined as \\\(  x= \frac{X}{N} \\\)
(large \\\(  N \\\) values can be assumed to secure continuity of the new
system state variable).

As one-step operators act on continuous functions they can be expanded
using Taylor series up to the second order terms:

\begin{equation}
 \boldsymbol{E}\[f(x)\] = f(x+\Delta x) \approx f(x) + \Delta x \partial\_x f(x) + \frac{\Delta x^2}{2} \partial^2\_x f(x) ,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 \boldsymbol{E}^{-1}\[f(x)\] = f(x-\Delta x) \approx f(x) -\Delta x \partial\_x f(x) + \frac{\Delta x^2}{2} \partial^2\_xf(x) , 
\end{equation}

where \\\(  \Delta x \\\) is smallest possible increment of the
continuous system state variable, \\\(  \frac{1}{N} \\\). After this
expansion Master equation, Eq. \eqref{master}, becomes
Fokker-Planck equation:

\begin{equation}
 \partial\_t \omega(x,t) = -\partial\_x \[A(x) \omega(x,t)\]+ \frac{1}{2} \partial^2\_x \[D(x) \omega(x,t)\] , \label{fokpla}
\end{equation}

where \\\(  A(x) \\\) and \\\(  D(x) \\\) are custom functions:

\begin{equation}
 A(x) = N (\pi^{+}(x)-\pi^{-}(x)) = \sigma\_1 (1-x) -\frac{\sigma\_2 x}{\tau(x)} , 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 D(x) = \pi^{+}(x)+\pi^{-}(x) \approx \frac{2 h x(1-x)}{\tau(x)} . 
\end{equation}

The above Fokker-Planck equation, \eqref{fokpla}, can be
rewritten as Langevin equation:

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} x = A(x) \mathrm{d} t + \sqrt{D(x)} \mathrm{d} W= \left\[ \sigma\_1 (1-x) - \frac{\sigma\_2 x}{\tau(x)} \right\]\mathrm{d} t + \sqrt{\frac{2 h x (1-x)}{\tau(x)}} \mathrm{d} W .
\end{equation}

To simplify model we can introduce dimensionless time, \\\(  t\_s = ht \\\):

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} x = \left\[ \varepsilon\_1 (1-x) -\frac{\varepsilon\_2 x}{\tau(x)} \right\] \mathrm{d} t\_s +\sqrt{\frac{2 x (1-x)}{\tau(x)}} \mathrm{d} W\_s , \label{lanx}
\end{equation}

where \\\(  \varepsilon\_i \\\) are accordingly rescaled original model
parameters, \\\(  \varepsilon\_i = \frac{\sigma\_i}{h} \\\).

Introducing price and return {#price-return}
----------------------------

While introducing variable time scale we assumed that there are at least
two types of traders - some are rational, while some are not so. In
recent agent-based modeling \[cite id="Cristelli2012Fermi"\] it is also
very common to assume that there are two types of traders in the market
- fundamentalists and noise traders. By definition fundamentalists are
assumed to be rational investors aiming for the long term profits, while
noise traders rely on technical trading strategies aiming for short term
profits.

Fundamentalists base their decision on information about the stock's
value in the market. This information is quantified via so-called
fundamental price, \\\(  P\_f(t) \\\). Fundamentalists expect that in
long-run market will tend towards correct estimate of the stock's value.
If \\\(  P\_f(t) > P(t) \\\) fundamentalists will expect growth of
prices, thus placing buying orders. In the opposite case they'll attempt
to sell stock, as they will expect decrease of price. These ideas are
mathematical put down as \[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco"\]:

\begin{equation}
 D\_f(t) = N\_f(t) \ln \frac{P\_f(t)}{P(t)} , 
\end{equation}

where \\\(  D\_f(t) \\\) is fundamentalists', \\\(  N\_f \\\) entities,
excess demand at a given time.

Contrary noise traders attempt to forecast future prices based on
previous price movements. As they are using price charts to make
forecast, they are also called chartists. As very is a wide selection of
very different chartist trading strategies, chartists are likely to make
very different forecasts. Difference in forecasts would lead to
difference in bids. This intrinsic disagreement might be macroscopically
seen as irrational mood of noise traders. Thus theirs' excess demand can
mathematical be expressed as \[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco"\]:

\begin{equation}
 D\_c(t) = r\_0 N\_c(t) \xi(t) , 
\end{equation}

where \\\(  \xi(t) \\\) is an average noise traders' mood, \\\( r\_0 \\\) is scaling term, which might also be seen as relative impact of
chartists' trades on the market.

Now one can use Walras law in order to obtain definition of price and,
later, return. Original Walras law \[cite id="Jolink1996Routledge"\]
assumes that trading in the market occurs trough the market maker, who
stabilizes the market. Market is consider to be stable if all agents'
excess demands equal zero:

\begin{equation}
 \sum\_{i=1}^{N} D\_i(t) = D\_f(t) + D\_c(t) = N\_f(t) \ln\frac{P\_f(t)}{P(t)} + r\_0 N\_c(t) \xi(t) = 0 , 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 P(t) = P\_f(t) \exp \left\[ r\_0 \frac{N\_c(t)}{N\_f(t)}\xi(t) \right\] , 
\end{equation}

here one can assume that fundamental price remains constant (i.e., it is
not a function of time). As we have definition of price, now we can
obtain definition of return:

\begin{equation}
 r\_{T}(t)=\ln \frac{P(t)}{P(t-T)} = r\_0 \left\[\frac{x(t)}{1-x(t)} \xi(t) - \frac{x(t-T)}{1-x(t-T)} \xi(t-T)\right\] . \label{fullret}
\end{equation}

Note that in the above we have expressed \\\(  N\_c(t) \\\) and \\\( N\_f(t) \\\) using \\\(  x(t) \\\), which we have defined previously as a
systems state variable of Kirman's model. As fundamentalists are
rational we have set that \\\(  N\_f(t)/N = 1-x(t) \\\), while chartists
are thus directly related to \\\(  x(t) \\\).

In \[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco"\] definition of return, \eqref{fullret}
is simplified by using adiabatic approximation. Namely
it is assumed that noise traders' change their mood very quickly, if
compared with \\\(  x(t) \\\). This gives simpler definition of return:

\begin{equation}
 r(t)=r\_0 \frac{x(t)}{1-x(t)} \zeta(t) , \label{return}
\end{equation}

where \\\(  \zeta(t) \\\) is a change of noise traders' mood, \\\( \zeta(t) = \xi(t) - \xi(t-T) \\\). This change can be modeled in
different ways, in \[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco"\] it is modeled using
spin noise. In such case \\\(  y(t)=\frac{x(t)}{1-x(t)} \\\) can be seen
as absolute return, for which we will derive stochastic model in the
next section of this text.

Derivation of stochastic model for absolute return, y
-----------------------------------------------------

Eqs. \eqref{lanx} and \eqref{return} were derived in
\[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco"\] (stochastic model was derived in a bit
different way), but Alfarano et al. stopped there and did not derive
stochastic differential equation for absolute return. In order to obtain
stochastic model for absolute return we use variable substitution
formula, via Ito's lemma, \[cite id="Gardiner2009Springer"\]:

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} y(x) = \left\[ A\_x(x) \partial\_x y(x) +\frac{1}{2} B\_x^2(x) \partial^2\_x y(x) \right\] \mathrm{d} t +B\_x(x) \partial\_x y(x) \mathrm{d} W , 
\end{equation}

to obtain stochastic model for \\\(  y \\\):

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} y = \left(\varepsilon\_1 + y\frac{2-\varepsilon\_2}{\tau(y)} \right) (1 + y) \mathrm{d} t\_s +\sqrt{\frac{2 y}{\tau(y)}} ( 1 + y ) \mathrm{d} W\_s . \label{lany}
\end{equation}

If we consider \\\(  \tau(y) = y^{-\alpha}  \\\), this selection
might be backed by the positive correlation between trading activity and
absolute return and also by the similarity of statistical properties,
and a limit of large \\\(  y \\\) values Eq. \eqref{lany} becomes:

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} y = (2-\varepsilon\_2) y^{2+\alpha} \mathrm{d}t\_s + \sqrt{2 y^{3+\alpha}} \mathrm{d} W\_s . \label{lanyour}
\end{equation}

We find that Eq. \eqref{lanyour} is very similar to stochastic
differential equation consider in \[cite id="Ruseckas2010PhysRevE"\]:

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} y = \left( \eta - \frac{\lambda}{2} \right)y^{2 \eta -1} \mathrm{d} t + y^\eta \mathrm{d} W , \label{oursde}
\end{equation}

which is known to give power law statistics:

\begin{equation}
 S(f) \sim \frac{1}{f^\beta}, \quad\beta=1+\frac{\lambda-3}{2(\eta-1)} , 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 p(y) \sim y^{-\lambda} . 
\end{equation}

As relations between different model parameters are \\\(  \eta =\frac{3+\alpha}{2} \\\), \\\(  \lambda = \varepsilon\_2 + \alpha+1 \\\) (obtained by directly comparing stochastic differential equations
\eqref{lanyour} and \eqref{oursde}), we expect that
\\\(  y \\\) defined by Eq. \eqref{lany} will also have power law
statistics:

\begin{equation}
 S(f) \sim \frac{1}{f^\beta}, \quad\beta=1+\frac{\varepsilon\_2+\alpha-2}{1+\alpha} , 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 p(y) \sim y^{-\varepsilon\_2 - \alpha -1} . 
\end{equation}

Using these predictions we have reproduced \\\(  1/f \\\) noise in three
distinct cases (see [Fig 1.](#attachment_1776), this figure is featured
in \[cite id="Kononovicius2012PhysA"\]).

density (b) in three distinct cases, \\\( \alpha =0 \\\) (red squares), \\\( \alpha=1 \\\) (blue
circles) and \\\( \alpha=2 \\\) (magenta triangles), of considered stochastic model,
Eq. (6). Other model parameters were set as follows: \\\( \varepsilon\_1=0 \\\), \\\( \varepsilon\_2 =2-\alpha \\\).
Solid curves are inverse power law fits: (a) \\\( \lambda=3 \\\) (all three cases), (b)
\\\( \beta = 1 \\\) (all three cases)."){#attachment_1776} 

The above comparison is very important as stochastic differential
equation \eqref{oursde} is a more general case of our stochastic
model of return \[cite id="Gontis2010Intech"\]. Working on this approach
further we might be able to create agent-based model providing more
sophisticated statistical features reproduced by the model consider in
\[cite id="Gontis2010Intech"\].

There is another stochastic model whose stochastic differential equation
resembles Eq. \eqref{lany}. It is so-called generalized CEV
process, which was consider in \[cite id="Reimann2011PhysA"\]:

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} y = a y \mathrm{d} t + b y^\eta \mathrm{d} W .\label{cev}
\end{equation}

Eq. \eqref{cev} is noted to be a special case of Eq. \eqref{oursde},
when exponential diffusion restriction is applied \[cite
id="Reimann2011PhysA"\]. Though comparison with generalized CEV process
is important on its own, as generalized CEV process encompass many
stochastic models used in risk management. In order to obtain similar
stochastic differential equation we have to linearize drift function of
Eq. \eqref{lany} (i.e. set \\\(  \varepsilon\_2 = 2 \\\)).
Similarity is once again obtained in the limit of large \\\(  y \\\)
values:

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d} y = \varepsilon\_1 y \mathrm{d} t\_s + \sqrt{2y^{3+\alpha}} \mathrm{d} W\_s . 
\end{equation}

Due to the similarity between Eqs. \eqref{oursde} and \eqref{cev},
theoretical predictions of statistical properties remain the
same. Though now they have a bit simpler mathematical expression:

\begin{equation}
 S(f) \sim \frac{1}{f^\beta}, \quad\beta=1+\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha} , 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 p(y) \sim y^{- \alpha -3} . 
\end{equation}

In case of generalized CEV process we can't reproduce \\\(  1/f \\\)
noise in three distinct cases, but we can still obtain three different
power law spectral densities in three distinct cases (in each cases
giving precise prediction). In [Fig 2.](#attachment_1777), this figure
is featured in \[cite id="Kononovicius2012PhysA"\], we have shown that
theoretical predictions for CEV process are also valid for \\\(  y \\\)
defined by Eq. \eqref{lany}.

Applet
------

This applet numerically solves Eq. \eqref{lany} using
Euler-Maruyama method \[cite id="Kloeden1999Springer"\]. In such case
Eq. \eqref{lany} becomes a set of difference equations:

\begin{equation}
 y\_{i+1} = y\_i + \frac{\kappa^2}{1+y\_i} \left\[\frac{\varepsilon\_1 y\_i}{\tau(y\_i)} + 2 - \varepsilon\_2\right\] + \kappa \sqrt{2} \varsigma\_i , 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 t\_{i+1} = t\_i + \frac{\kappa^2 \tau(y\_i)}{y\_i(1+y\_i)^2} , 
\end{equation}

where \\\(  \kappa \\\) is numerical precision parameter (numerical
solution tends to improve with smaller values of the parameter (applet
uses \\\(  \kappa =0.4 \\\))), while \\\(  \varsigma\_i \\\) is normally
distributed (zero mean, unit variance) random variable. Precision and
quality of numerical results are also influenced by the enforced
restrictions (in applet values of \\\(  y \\\) are restricted in \\\( \[0.01,100\] \\\) value interval).

The applet plots both time series and statistical properties in real
time. In the first few moments it may show incorrect and very
approximate results - please wait a bit for a program to "settle down",
it will start to show correct and precise results as time passes.
