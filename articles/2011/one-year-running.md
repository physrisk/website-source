A
year has passed since the opening of the renew Physics of Risk website.
This year was highly productive for us, [the
contributors]({filename}/pages/about.md). We have
published 7 new econophysical, 1 fractal + 3 stochastic + 3 agent-based,
models and 18 models of varying business processes. Some of the models
belonging to these two groups are very similar (we have found that most
similar are Bass diffusion model and [Unidirectional Kirman's
model]({filename}/articles/2011/unidirectional-kirman-model.md))
thus serving as a proof for the potential applicability of the ideas
developed in the econophysical sections.<!--more--> Sadly none of the business models are
currently translated to English, though all econophysical models are
available in English and Lithuanian languages as we have promised. This
is due to different aims behind the sections - econophysical models
represent scientific research done by the contributors, while business
models were published as an introduction to computer modeling aimed at
Lithuanian businessmen.

This year is also marked by numbers related to you, visitors of Physics
of Risk. Sadly there we have not received any comments yet, though most
probably it's due to very specified and technical field Physics of Risk
website specializes in. But during this year we had more than 3500
unique visitors and over 13 thousand page hits. That is approximately 10
users per day, each you of hitting a bit more than 3 pages on average.

Physics of Risk had most visits during the exam sessions in Lithuanian
universities (during January and June) and also during first and last
months of our first year running (during October, 2011 and November,
2010). Our typical visitor uses Windows operating system and Mozilla
Firefox, as most probably an average Lithuanian internet user does. He
is interested in fractals, dynamical chaos, computer modeling and
physics. He also chooses Google as his main tool for doing internet
searches. Though most visitors have come to Physics of Risk through the
main webpage of Science for business and society,
<https://mokslasplius.lt>. Personal webpages of some of the contributors
(<https://gontis.eu> and <https://kononovicius.lt/>) have
also directed some of you to this website.

[Ising
model]({filename}/articles/2010/ising-model.md)
was the most well received model on our website. Some of its graphs were
reused on Cocktail Party Physics blog (available
[here](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/2011/08/02/teetering-on-the-edge-of-chaos/ "Cocktail Party Physics on Scientific American Blog Network")
and bei
[here](https://twistedphysics.typepad.com/cocktail_party_physics/2011/08/teetering-on-the-edge-of-chaos.html "Cocktail Party Physics")).
While [Long-range memory stochastic model of
return]({filename}/articles/2010/long-range-memory-stochastic-model-return.md)
came in close second. The most read news was written on [the
presentation during ICCGI 2011
conference]({filename}/articles/2011/agent-based-versus-macroscopic-modeling-competition-business-processes-economics.md).
Actually the presentation itself was also well received - author of the
underlying paper were awarded "IARIA Best Paper Award".

Concluding we would like to ensure that our research is nowhere near
completion and thus publication of new models most probably won't cease.
It is highly probable that sometime in the near future we will
participate in another project which will encourage us to further
develop Physics of Risk website. Some texts or models will be also
published without waiting for the next project to come along. We think
that public availability of scientific research is becoming more and
more important in the XXI century, hopefully this will drive us towards
new texts on Physics of Risk!
