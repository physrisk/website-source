Working on *Physics of Risk* is very interesting and
useful experience. This experience provides valuable insights into the
mechanics behind various complex systems, well modeled by macroscopic
models. Using our experience we are able to obtain qualitative and
quantitative agreements between varying models. In our newest
publication \[cite id="Daniunas2011ICCGI"\] we have used one-step
formalism \[cite id="VanKampen2007NorthHolland"\] to obtain macroscopic
treatments of Kirman model \[cite id="Kirman1993QJE"\].

One part of this work is dedicated to the transition between original
Kirman model (was previously discussed on [this
website]({filename}/articles/2010/kirman-ants.md))
and stochastic Kirman's model for return. Previously Alfarano et al.
have attempted to obtain stochastic treatment of Kirman's model, though
they stopped after obtaining stochastic model for population fraction
\[cite id="Alfarano2005CompEco"\] (we have discussed their derivation on
[Physics of
Risk]({filename}/articles/2010/stochastic-ant-colony-model.md)).
We derive analogous equation for population fraction by using one-step
formalism and further use Ito variable substitution formula \[cite
id="Gardiner2009Springer"\] to obtain stochastic model for return.

Another important part of this work is dedicated to Bass diffusion model
\[cite id="Bass1969ManSci"\], which we found to be ideologically similar to
the very same Kirman's model. Indeed as we show in \[cite
id="Daniunas2011ICCGI"\], Bass diffusion is actually analogous to
unidirectional Kirman's model (see discussion on [our
website]({filename}/articles/2011/unidirectional-kirman-model.md)).
