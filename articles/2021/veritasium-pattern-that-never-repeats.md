It is obvious that you can perfectly tile floor of a room using square or
rhomboid tiles. Similarly it would be easy if we would triangular or
hexagonal tiles. Furthermore in all these case we could rotate these
patterns by less than 360 degrees and still get valid layouts. Namely you
could rotate rhomboid tiles two times, triangles - 3 times, squares - 4
times and hexagons - 6 times. But what about 5 rotations? Or 5-fold
symmetry?

More details in a more attractive video form are given in the video by
Veritasium, which touches upon fractal created by British mathematician
Sir Roger Penrose - Penrose fractal.
