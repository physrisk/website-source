In the [last post]({filename}/articles/2021/random-walk-as-ar-process.md)
we have seen that auto-correlation function breaks when try to analyze
random walk time series. We have used differencing technique which has
allowed us to circumvent non-stationarity of the random walk series.

In the upcoming post in our [ARFIMA series](/tag/arfima-series) we will use
another technique known as partial auto-correlation function (abbr., PACF).
This new technique is discussed by
[ritvikmath](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUcpVoi5KkJmnE3bvEhHR0Q) in
the video below. Watch in order to understand the new tool.
