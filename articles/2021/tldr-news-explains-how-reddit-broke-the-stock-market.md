Big investors borrowed lots of GameStop stocks in anticipation that the price
will drop (they "shorted" the stock). But the price did not drop. The big
investors "shorted" further expecting that other market participants would
follow suit in selling GameStop stocks. They didn't and then trolls from
reddit joined the fray...

No one knows when and how this will end, but some people on reddit will earn
a lot. While some big capital investors will hopefully loose a lot and learn
a lesson.

Detailed explanation of what is happening in the following video by the TLDR
News US.
