Another excellent series from [Extra
Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) is
dedicated to the fight against Standard Oil, the megacorporation of the
1900s. We share this video becomes its themes strongly overlap with
[an earlier video]({filename}/articles/2021/wisecrack-billionaires.md) from
Wisecrack we have shared few weeks ago. Numerous historical billionaires
mentioned in the Wisecrack videos are also seen in this series by [Extra
Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg).

We invite you to watch the first video and find later videos on the [Extra
Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) channel
on Youtube.
