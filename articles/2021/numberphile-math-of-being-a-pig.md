For many [board games](/tag/board-games/) have become a tool to retain their
sanity during COVID-19 lockdowns. These games vary in their complexity and
the mechanics they use. In this
[Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A)
video mathematician Ben Sparks uses [statistics](/tag/statistics/) to
develop a strategy how to play game known as ["Pass the
Pigs"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Pigs). In general this method

games](/tag/board-games/).
