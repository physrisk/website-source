[Last time]({filename}/articles/2021/arma-models.md) we have combined AR(p)
and MA(q) models to make ARMA(p, q) model. We are getting quite close to
understanding what ARFIMA processes are, but to do that we still have things
to look at. This time lets take into account letter I (which stands for
"integrated") - lets look at ARIMA models.

Although in [the earlier posts](/tag/topic-arfima/) we have seen that
ARMA(p, q) models can produce non-stationary time series, fitting these
models to non-stationary data is quite problematic. Therefore in practice
ARMA(p, q) models are used to study and forecast only stationary time
series [cite id="Holmes2021ATSA"].

[In an earlier post]({filename}/articles/2021/random-walk-as-ar-process.md)
we have used differencing technique to transform non-stationary [random
walk](/tag/brownian-motion/) into uncorrelated stationary time series ([white
noise](/tag/white-noise/)). Not surprisingly differencing is also behind
ARIMA models.

In ARIMA(p, d, q) models ARMA(p, q) is used to forecast not the time series
itself (\\\( x\_t \\\)), but the \\\( d \\\)-th difference of \\\( x\_t \\\).
If we are considering second difference (\\\( d = 2 \\\)) of \\\( x\_t \\\),
then we have to use ARMA on time series \\\( z\_t \\\):

\begin{equation}
    z\_t = y\_t - y\_{t-1} = ( x\_t - x\_{t-1} ) - ( x\_{t-1} - x\_{t-2} )
         = x\_t - 2 x\_{t-1} + x\_{t-2} .
\end{equation}

In the above \\\( y\_t = x\_t - x\_{t-1} \\\) is the first difference of
\\\( x\_t \\\).

Excellent, but what if you have \\\( z\_t \\\) (e.g., you have forecasted
values into the future) and you want to obtain \\\( x\_t \\\)? Simply use
cumulative sum \\\( d \\\) times (\\\( d = 2 \\\) in our example):

\begin{equation}
    y\_t = \sum\_{i=1}^{t} z\_i + y\_0 , \quad
    x\_t = \sum\_{i=1}^{t} y\_i + x\_0 .
\end{equation}

Forecasting is beyond the scope and interest of this blog, but here you can
use the app below to explore time series generated by the ARIMA model for
given parameter values.

For example, notice that ARIMA(1, 0, 0) and ARIMA(0, 1, 0) both model
[random walk](/tag/brownian-motion/). ARIMA(1, 0, 0) is equivalent to AR(1)
and we have already [seen that it models random
walk]({filename}/articles/2021/random-walk-as-ar-process.md). For ARIMA(0, 1, 0)
we understand that ARMA(0, 0) is used to model the first differences of
\\\( x\_t \\\):

\begin{equation}
    y\_t = \xi\_t ,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    x\_t = \sum\_{i=1}^t y\_t + x\_0 = \sum\_{i=1}^t \xi\_t + x\_0 .
\end{equation}

In the above we see just a sum (integral) of white noise, \\\( \xi\_t \\\),
which actually is the definition of [random walk](/tag/brownian-motion/).
