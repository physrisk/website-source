We,
participants of project *Science of business and society* (lt. *Mokslas
verslui ir visuomenei*), are happy to present renewed website dedicated
to Physics of Risk. One of the obvious updates is new theme, but the
look of site is not the only thing which has changed - from now on
Physics of Risk will also be available in English!

As website is now available in two languages all of the old models,
which were created for project *Science. Scientists. Society* (lt.
*Mokslas. Mokslininkai. Visuomenė*), are now queued for minor
improvements and translation. <del>All of the old models are available in the
copy
of the old Physics of Risk website (though content is available only in
Lithuanian).</del>
