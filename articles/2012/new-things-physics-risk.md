Physics of Risk meets new year with some significant improvements.

Firstly all of the texts on models were converted from page to post
format. This small improvement will enable flexible handling of main
topics. Now such models as [Kirman's unidirectional
model]({filename}/articles/2011/unidirectional-kirman-model.md)
will appear in all relevant topics covered by Physics of Risk - in the
given case you'll see the model under both agent-based modeling and
business processes main topics. Some general models will find their
place under the new "General models" topic.<!--more-->

The discussed improvements enables us to cover two very important events
related to the Physics of Risk. First one is the annual meeting of COST
P10: Physics of Risk held in Vilnius in 2006. See [the corresponding
page](/vilnius-2006-cost-p10 "COST P10 Vilnius 2006")
for conference program and slides. Another important "event" has only
just started - the brand new European Union flagship project
FuturICT.

Most of the improvements were done "under the hood". For example we have
switch from the outdated F2 theme to our own PhysRisk2012, which
visually is similar to our design under F2, yet is more compact and
offers some new functionality very useful to us. One of these functions
is the ability to add featured images to the posts. We have also
improved some of the custom plugins and added two new widgets seen on
the right sidebar.
