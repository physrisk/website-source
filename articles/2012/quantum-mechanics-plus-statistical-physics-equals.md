Quantum mechanics and statistical physics use very similar and
inter-connected concepts.  E.g., the latter is concerned with distribution
and probabilities, while the former operates with wave functions and
amplitudes. Even the essential equations, master and Shrodinger, appear to
be similar:

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \psi(t) = H \psi(t) \quad\text{and} \quad i \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \psi(t) = H\psi(t) . 
\end{equation}

The only difference is the imaginary factor i! But these similarities
lie just on the surface...

You can read more about it in a draft paper by J. C. Baez and J.
Biamonte \[cite id="Baez2012"\]. Please be sure to buy one, if you like
and if it becomes available! Currently you can get from the arXiv
website (see the references section).
