Quantum mechanics
and statistical physics use very similar and inter-connected concepts.
Ex. the latter is concerned with distribution and probabilities, while
the former operates with wave functions and amplitudes. Even the
essential equations, master and Shrodinger, appear to be similar:


\begin{equation}
 \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \psi(t) = H \psi(t) \quad\text{and} \quad i \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \psi(t) = H\psi(t) . 
\end{equation}


The only difference is the imaginary factor i! But these similarities
lie just on the surface...

You can read more about it in a draft paper by J. C. Baez and J.
Biamonte \[cite id="Baez2012"\]. Please be sure to buy one, if you like
and if it becomes available! Currently you can get from the arXiv
website (see the references section).
