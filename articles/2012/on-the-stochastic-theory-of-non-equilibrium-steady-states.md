In October 2012
our group has familiarized themselves with this interesting theory. Few
seminars, which were held at VU ITPA, on the stochastic theory of
nonequilibrium steady states were read by dr. Julius Ruseckas, one the
researchers in our group. This theory is discussed in two articles
recently published in the Physical Reports journal \[cite
id="Zhang2012PhysRep, Ge2012PhysRep"\]. Read
on for the links to the
articles.
