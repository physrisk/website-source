Imagine that you have
to measure the surface area of the lake by using only a cannon! Let us
assume that the geometric shape of the lake is too complex to be dealt
with using simple formulas and that you have almost infinite supply of
cannon balls. In such case you just have to hope that you are perfectly
random shooter! Why so?

If your shots cover the hitting area of the cannon uniformly then you
can obtain the area of the lake by estimating the probability to hit it:


\begin{equation}
 S\_{fig} = p S\_{hit} , 
\end{equation}


here \\\(  S\_{fig}  \\\) is an estimate of the surface area of
certain geometric shape (lake for example), \\\(  p \\\) is an estimate
of the probability to hit the shape, while \\\(  S\_{hit} \\\) is the
hitting area of the cannon. The obtained are of course will be only
approximate, but one can arrive reasonably near the actual answer.

Next we illustrate this method by applying it towards three geometric
shapes - square, circle and Euclidean egg. Why the Euclidean egg? Well,
there are numerous reasons for it, one of them being Easter. Happy
Easter!<!--more-->

Unit square
-----------

Unit circle (estimation of the pi value)
----------------------------------------

It should be evident that the area of unit circle is equal to pi. Thus
this case might also serve as pi value estimator.

Euclidean egg
-------------

egg itself is inside the pink rectangle). The main part of the egg
consists of the circle in the middle of the graph (its radius is equals
2). This egg is inside two larger circles, centers of which are on the
sides, with radius 4. While the smallest circle closes up the egg from
the top (its center lies on
(0,2))."){#attachment_2307} 

In [Fig. 5](#attachment_2307) you can see the Euclidean egg. The
geometric shape is rather complex, but might be dealt with if you have
decent skill in geometry. Thus the process might be still rather
confusing:


\begin{equation}
 S\_{fig} = \frac{\pi}{4} (4-2\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{\pi}{8}4^2 + \frac{\pi}{2} 2^2 + \frac{\pi}{8} 4^2 - \frac{1}{2} 4\cdot 2 \approx 15.93 . 
\end{equation}


While be using the aforementioned method we can rather easily obtain the
answer very close to the precise one. See [Fig. 6](#attachment_2306) and
[Fig. 7](#attachment_2308) on the application of the Monte Carlo method
in this case.
