**Topic:** "Physics is not a risk: Brief introduction into the Physics of
Risk"  

**Speaker:** [Aleksejus Kononovicius](https://kononovicius.lt/)  

**Briefly:** Social sciences have accomplished many different things.  Yet
it should be evident that there is a place for improvements - to look into
the old and new social problems a bit differently. As many of the social
problems are strongly non-linear and very complex, the physicists' point of
view is very useful. This, new, point of view is known as Physics of Risk.  

**When?** 18th of October, 17:00.  

**Where?** VU [Faculty of Physics (Saulėtekio al. 9, III rūmai,
Vilnius)](https://www.ff.vu.lt/), 201 auditorium.  

**Organized by:** VU Faculty of Physics Students Scientific Association.
