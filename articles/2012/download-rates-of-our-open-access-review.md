Previously, approximately 2 years
ago, we have
[written]({filename}/articles/2010/a-non-linear-double-stochastic-model-of-return.md)
that we published a review of our works \[cite id="Gontis2010Intech"\]
in a book by open-access publisher. Recently we discovered that during
the recent two and a half years this books was downloaded almost 7000
times (namely 8 times per day). It was downloaded by the people all
around the world - with the USA, China, India, Japan, Germany being the
most active countries in the process. It is an excellent result!

While being happy with excellent "diffusion" of our ideas via
open-access publisher, we would also like to speak about the improving
statistics of the Physics of Risk website. In 2012 we expect to be
visited 12 thousand times! It is slightly better than in 2011, in which
we had 11 thousand visits. Improvement is small, yet promising a bright
future.<!--more-->

More on Physics of Risk stats
-----------------------------

Unlike the last year we do not observe a seasonality in the visitor
statistics - only the summer is relatively low activity period. Also
unlike the last year Windows 7 is the most popular OS (last year it was
Windows XP). Some other things have remained unchanged - Firefox is
still the most popular browser, Google - the most used search engine,
[main portal of the MVV project](https://mokslasplius.lt) - the best
referrer, article on [Ising
model]({filename}/articles/2010/ising-model.md) - the
most read article. The other popular articles included [the discussion
on the multifractality of time
series]({filename}/articles/2011/multifractality-time-series.md)
and [the article on the Newton-Raphson
method]({filename}/articles/2011/newton-raphson.md).
It is worthwhile to mention [the article on elementary
automatons]({filename}/articles/2012/wolframs-elementary-automatons.md),
which has recently received "extended" international attention (it is
referenced in [the
article](https://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-677221-636232.html "Link to the article by the Chinese blogger")
by a certain Chinese blogger).

We have also finally received some input by our readers! Do not be
afraid to post more replies! Well, and thank You.
