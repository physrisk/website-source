In
February and Match three very important conference to the
econophysicists were held: ["Unsolved Problems on
Noise"](http://www.saha.ac.in/cs/upon6.ecmp/Home.html), ["Verhandlungen
DPG"](http://berlin12.dpg-tagungen.de/index.html?lang=en) and ["Open
Readings" (lt. "Laisvieji skaitymai")](http://www.openreadings.eu/). Our
B. Kaulakys, V. Gontis, A. Kononovicius, P. Purlys and R. Kazakevičius
have given oral and poster presentations at these conference.
Presentations were mostly concerned with our newest achievements in [the
applications of Kirman
model](/tag/kirman-model) and [burst
statistics](/tag/burst-statistics).<!--more-->

Two oral presenation in the sixth international conference on "Unsolved
Problems on Noise" were given by B. Kaulakys. He gave a speech on our
works concerning extreme event, i.e. burst, statistics - ["Modeling by
the nonlinear stochastic differential equation of the power-law
distribution of extreme events in the financial
systems"](/uploads/2012/03/Kaulakys_UPoN2012_Events.pdf).
The other one was related to the application of Kirman model towards 1/f
noise modeling - ["1/f Fluctuations from the Microscopic Herding
Model"](/uploads/2012/03/Kaulakys_UPoN2012_Herding.pdf).

Our approaches towards financial markets using Kirman model were
presented by V. Gontis in COST MP 0801 third work-group meeting in
Jerusalem.

The main topics were also covered by A. Kononovicius in the Spring
Meeting of German Physical Society (de. DPG) in Berlin. He talked about
the Kirman model - ["Microscopic herding model leading to long-range
processes and 1/f noise with application to absolute return in ﬁnancial
markets"](/uploads/2012/03/Kaulakys2012Verhandlungen.pdf).
While also giving a poster presentation on the burst statistics -
["Bursting behavior of non-linear stochastic model and empirical
high-frequency
return"](/uploads/2012/03/Kononovicius2012Verhandlungen.pdf).

Master degree students P. Purlys (["Various ways of introducing herding
behavior into the agent-based models of complex
systems"](/uploads/2012/03/Purlys2012OR.pdf))
and R. Kazakevičius ("1/f noise generated by superposition of relaxation
processes generated by identical white noise") have presented their
yearly papers in the international conference for young students of
physics and natural sciences "Open Readings", which was held in the
Faculty of Physics of Vilnius University.
