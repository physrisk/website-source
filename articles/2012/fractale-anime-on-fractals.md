Recently [the
largest Lithuanian anime community](http://animezona.net) has launched
its 2011 anime awards. In context of Physics of Risk I have found one
very interesting nominee - Fractale. It is nominated as the best
adventure and best science fiction anime of the year, though so far it
is far behind the leaders.

First thing each viewer see is memorable opening sequence, which is rich
of strange patterns and fractals. The view is nice, interesting and very
sophisticated.<!--more-->

While the story takes us to the distant future, in which people live in
utopia of limitless freedom and possibilities. All the manual and boring
works are being done by the doppels (digitalized robots?), while people
roam all other the place and do what they like without any concerns or
problems. At first this seems the most disturbing as this freedom causes
people to distance other people - even kids are being looked after by
the machines and not their parents, who might be at completely different
and distant place. This utopian world has only one single and very
general rule - everyone at the certain time of day must pray to certain
stars in the sky. The hidden catch is that the so-called stars and not
stars, but transmitters connected to the "Fractale".

I want go in the further details as their not interesting in terms of
Physics of Risk. I'll just provide a minor spoiler - the story itself
deeply relates to fractals, though the connection might have been more
sophisticated.
