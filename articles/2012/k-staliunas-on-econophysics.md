> Traditionally it is thought that economics and physics are very

> on the other hand think that physicists are busy dividing molecules
> into atoms, create atomic weapons and lasers and are able to fix AC
> sockets, while having absolutely no understanding in other,
> nontechnical, fields. Evidently this oversimplified thinking is
> incorrect - economics and physics have things in many common. And with
> the time more common things are discovered.

> some of the processes in both sciences are very similar! Thus
> physicists can successfully apply their knowledge and experience to
> understand, describe, model and forecast various processes in
> economics. Econophysics is a cognitive science, which attempts to see
> the reasons behind various economic processes. Physicists are always
> obsessed with simple equation - why?

These are free translations (done by [A.
Kononovicius](http://kononovicius.lt/))
of the texts published in "Science and life" (lt. "Mokslas ir
gyvenimas") journal by prof. Kęstutis Staliūnas \[cite
id="Staliunas2003MG, Staliunas2004MG"\]. These are few rare texts about
econophysics published in Lithuanian language.

Another interesting text is an electronic course material \[cite
id="Staliunas2002VU"\] written for the students of Physics Faculty of
Vilnius University (the econophysics course was taught there in
2002-2003). This contains broader review of introductory topics to
econophysics.
