In the last year we have
[already
written](/agent-based-versus-macroscopic-modeling-competition-business-processes-economics "Agent-based versus macroscopic modeling of competition and business processes in economics ")
that work in the context of Physics of Risk provides varying insights
into very different complex systems. The previous article \[cite
id="Daniunas2011ICCGI"\] contained brief review of Physics of Risk
platform and discussions on some of the models published using it. This
article received great response and was even awarded the Best Paper
Award by the publisher IARIA.<!--more-->

This year we were asked to submit a broader review of our work done in
the context of Physics of Risk. Thus we have gathered \[cite
id="Kononovicius2012IntSys"\] all of our latest research and created a
very broad review of stochastic and agent-based modeling in the topics
of financial markets and marketing. The draft is available on
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3533 "[1202.3533] Agent-based Versus Macroscopic Modeling of Competition and Business Processes in Economics and Finance").
