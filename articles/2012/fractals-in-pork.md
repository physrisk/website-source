Previously (ex. while speaking about the
[multifractality of time
series](/multifractality-time-series)) we have
already discussed that fractals are observed in many daily phenomena.
Interestingly enough we can eat fractals for our breakfast! Recently we
have found an article \[cite id="Valous2010MeatSci"\] which studies
fractal structures, 1/f-like noise in ham!<!--more-->

The article is highly technical, thus it is recommend only for those
interested in the spatial applications of detrended fluctuation
analysis.
