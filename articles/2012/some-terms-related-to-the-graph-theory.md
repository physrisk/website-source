Network models are intimately related to a
certain branch of mathematics known as the graph theory. Actually
networks themselves are graphs! Thus further we briefly introduce some
of the terms related to the mathematical graph
theory.<!--more-->

In mathetmatics a **graph** is a collection of **vertices (or nodes)**
that are interconnected by **edges (or links, or arcs)**. Edges might be
either undirected or directed and they also might have weights assigned.

Graphs with directed edges are called **directed** graphs.

Undirected graph can be referred to as **complete** graph, if and only
if every node is connected to all other nodes.

Graph is **empty** if it does not posses any edges.

Edges are considered to be **adjacent** if they connect to one common
node. Nodes are considered to be **adjacent** if they are connected by
an edge.

Node's, in the undirected graph, **degree** is a number of nodes
adjacent to it.

**Chain or path** is a set of the adjacent edges.

**Circuit or cycle** is a path which has the same initial and final
nodes.

**Length** of the path is a number of edges in the path.

Graph H is a **subgraph** of graph G, if H is composed of G nodes and
edges.

H is an **induced** subgraph of G if it has exactly the edges that
appear in G.

Graph is considered to be **connected**, if any pair of nodes is
connected by the path.

**Connected** component of graph G is an induced subgraph of G.

Acyclic graph is called **forest**. Connected forest is called a
**tree**.
