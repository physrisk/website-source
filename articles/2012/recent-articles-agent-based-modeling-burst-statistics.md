In the next Physica A
issue (will be made available in February, 2012) our article \[cite
id="Kononovicius2012PhysA"\] will be published. The article is on the
agent-based reasoning for the stochastic models. Basically this article
incorporates knowledge obtained while working on the simple models
provided on Physics of Risk:<!--more-->

-   [Stochastic ant colony model](/stochastic-ant-colony-model),
-   [Agent based herding model of financial markets](/agent-based-herding-model-financial-markets),
-   [Multifractality of time series](/multifractality-time-series).

You can freely read a draft version in the arxiv. Or if you have access
to sciencedirect.com you'll find the final version there. Note that you
can freely play with the demonstrations related to the article here on
the Physics of Risk.

Recently we have submitted another paper \[cite id="Gontis2012ACS"\]
related to [the bursting statistics in stochastic
models](/brust-statistics-non-linear-stochastic-models "Brust statistics in non-linear stochastic models").
In this paper we show that our model using variable transformation can
be reduced to the well known Bessel process. Thus we can use the hitting
times of Bessel process to analytically analyze burst statistics of our
model - in the paper we analytical derive PDF for burst
durations.
