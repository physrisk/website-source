Modern
science strongly relies on the computer modeling. Most of the models in
the complexity science, the object of the Physics of Risk, requires
computer modeling and usually may not be dealt with analytically. For a
person familiar with the computer modeling it should be known that the
variety computer algorithms is very large and that there also is a
variety of ways to understand these algorithms. Thus each person might
solve the same complex task slightly differently and thus produce
slightly different results. This brings us to the point that in order to
comprehend what has been done by a certain scientist one should not only
study the equations and assumptions made by him, but one also needs to
have access to the source code of the software used by that certain
scientist.

Yet there is still a problem that only few scientists to make the source
code of their software public available. This behavior is not very
desired as in order to reproduce the same results other scientists must
make a lot of efforts. Some times the attempts to reproduce published
results fail. This problem may be solved by encouraging adoption of the
open source ideas by the scientific community.

We, the contributors of Physics of Risk, have already faced the negative
effects of the closed source culture, thus most of our models made
available on Physic of Risk are published together with their source
code. Though it is well hidden inside the applet's JAR archive (open it
with any modern archiver, inside you should find java file, which
contains the source code).
