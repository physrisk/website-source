The
convergence of economies is an interesting topic to countries, which are
significantly behind the leading countries in terms of economic
efficiency and standard of living. It should not be a great surprise
that the politicians of such developing countries name the economical
catch up as their primary political goal. Understanding the essence of
political debates on this topic and their interpretation i the media is
very challenging topic as economic globalization, or integration, is
very complex process. Though the basic understanding of what is known to
economists about the economic convergence might be obtained by checking
freely available source such as
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(economics)).

Our interest in this topic stems from the widely seen and heard, even
among specialists (economists scientists, financial analytics and
journalists), misunderstanding of the mechanics behind the observed
economical convergence. These some times even principal errors causes
society-wide mistrust in countries economical evolution and economical
perspectives. We would like to illustrate known laws using certain
examples and briefly analyze economic convergence of our region. We hope
that interactive tools provided in the text will enable You to
experiment with data and find the answers to your questions.
