Recent
hurricane, which struck east coast of the USA, has very interesting
symmetry properties. This natural phenomenon obeys the golden ratio!
Well at least such information has been circulating on the
[science.memebase.com](http://cheezburger.com/6722732544)! Similar
properties are also observed in some fractals such as Penrose tiling (we
have not yet discussed this fractal on Physics of Risk, thus we'd like
to recommend reading [an article on the
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling)).
