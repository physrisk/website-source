In a recent video [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium) talked
about a topic close to our heart - [power-law
distributions](/tag/power-law-distribution/)! It is a neat
video, which covers a lot of important models and concepts. And it also
explains the implications of power-law distributions on everyday life. We
invite you to watch it, and maybe revisit our posts on some of the models
discussed in the video (such as [The Saint Petersburg
paradox]({filename/articles/2013/the-saint-petersburg-paradox.md), [Ising
model]({filename}/articles/2010/ising-model.md), [self-organized
criticality](/tag/self-organized-criticality/) models, [Barabasi-Albert
model]({filename}/articles/2013/barabasi-albert-model.md)).
