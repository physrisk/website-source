This year I was invited to give lecture to gifted high school students
attending [Nacionalinė moksleivių akademija](https://nmakademija.lt). It
was a great experience for me. I hope that my lecture was at least a bit
useful and inspiring. You can find the slides
[here]({static}/uploads/2026/Kononovicius2026NMA.pdf).

Immediately after the lecture I have remembered that have forgotten to make
an important philosophical point, and to somewhat contradict the conclusion
made by [Veritasium](/tag/veritasium/) in a recent [video on power-law
distributions]({filename}/articles/2026/veritasium-on-power-law-distributions.md).

In the video's thumbnail, one can see a claim that "working hard is not
enough." I do agree with this point, but by the end of the video, one of the
hosts (Casper) suggests that in a power-law world, it becomes "more
important to be persistent than consistent". This interpretation is sound,
and the emphasis on persistence seems both intuitive and motivating. That
said, it is important to add a nuance to the discussion.

In environments governed by power laws, outcomes are often heavily
influenced by chance and/or external factors. As a result, many considerable
successes cannot be fully explained by individual qualities such as ability,
persistence, or consistency alone. From this perspective, persistence may
increase exposure to opportunities, while the ultimate magnitude of success
remains strongly shaped by factors outside individual control. The point I
am trying to make is well-presented in the [Talent vs Luck
model]({filename}/articles/2019/talent-vs-luck-model.md).

Similarly, the wealthiest agents in [kinetic exchange models with
savings]({filename}/articles/2013/modeling-wealth-distribution-using-kinetic-exchange-models.md)
are the ones with largest saving propensity. These agents are successful
because they contribute to the shared pot the least, while having a chance
at receiving an equal share of the pot back.
