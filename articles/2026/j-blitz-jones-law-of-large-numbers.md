In an [earlier post]({filename}/articles/2026/law-of-large-numbers.md) we
have taken a moral formal look at the [law of large
numbers](/tag/law-of-large-numbers/). But what about the intuition behind
this law? I believe this video by [Jeremy
Blitz-Jones](https://www.youtube.com/@mumiscrunk) provides a great general
level overview of the importance of this law.
