Happy New Year! It is time for the traditional post about our last year's
yield. And its still quite good. Though this year, I received some help from
my colleague [Vygintas Gontis](/author/vygintas-gontis/) who wrote four
posts on [macroeconomics](/tag/macroeconomics/) and prepared one
[interactive](/tag/interactive/) app.

![Number of posts written in English and still available on this site as of
the end of 2025]({static}/uploads/2026/overview-of-2025.png "The number of
posts written in English and still available on this iteration of Physics of
Risk (as of the end of 2025). The wide bars represent total number of posts
for each year since 2010, while the narrower bars represent a number of
posts containing an interactive app.")

We have started the year with various modifications of the [Colonel Blotto
game](/tag/colonel-blotto-game/). This series of posts culminated in Colonel
Blotto moving to an [adjacent field of
sports]({filename}/articles/2025/can-colonel-blotto-coach-football.md). Next
we have discussed [periodic polling effects and information delay in the
noisy voter model](/tag/poll-delayed-voter-model/) [cite
id="Kononovicius2024PhysA"]. While in the autumn, we have had couple of
posts on various assorted topics.

What's next? Still, I am bit overwhelmed and have no concrete plans, but
occasionally I'll post something interesting.
