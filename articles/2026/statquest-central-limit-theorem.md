We have already previously [shared a
video]({filename}/2023/3blue1brown-central-limit-theorem.md) about the
[central limit theorem](/tag/central-limit-theorem/), but recently I have
found another neat explanation by
[StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest). I would like to invite you
to watch it.
