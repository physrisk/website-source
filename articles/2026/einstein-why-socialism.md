Did you know that Albert Einstein once wrote an essay titled "Why
Socialism?" [cite id="Einstein1949MonRev"]. I did not either.  Recently I
have watched a YouTube video, which referred me to a video by [Dr.
Fatima](https://www.youtube.com/@dr.fatima) in which a broader discussion
about the essay, as well as about Physics in politics and problems faced by
Palestinian physicists, can be found. Feel free to watch the video linked
below, or go read the original essay [cite id="Einstein1949MonRev"].

My take away from both the video and the essay is an observation that in
capitalist society, you can make money through owning stuff only if you pay
laborers less than the value of their labor. To be fair, often the tools are
what enables the labor. Yet without a laborer the tool is often as useless.
Either way, such practice diverts the gains from the improving technology
and other increases in productivity to the pockets of the select few instead
of benefiting society as whole. The worst thing is that having deep pockets,
enables the select few to exert influence over politics and shaping the
society to their will. To break or circumvent check and balances that
should exist in free society.

## Additional note

After watching the video, reading the essay and discussing its contents with
couple of different people, I have a few things to add. Now on the social
media I get bombarded with low effort libertarian AI slop. Most of the time
it is various AI-generated comics about how bad it was to live in the Soviet
Union and how stupid young people are for trying to bring it back. Yes, they
are dumb, if they are trying to bring Soviet Union in all its glory. Yet,
Einstein advocates for a different thing - planned socialist economy with
strong democratic safeguards.

Though I think that given the inherent economic complexity, the need to
balance interests of many different groups, it would be extremely hard for
any committee to produce an economic plan. "Distributed" computing of the
[free markets](/tag/free-market/) does help with this. So, one needs to look
for a reasonable middle ground between the extreme ideas.
