Did you know that Albert Einstein once wrote an essay titled "Why
Socialism?" [cite id="Einstein1949MonRev"]. I did not either.  Recently I
have watched a YouTube video, which referred me to a video by [Dr.
Fatima](https://www.youtube.com/@dr.fatima) in which a broader discussion
about the essay, as well as about Physics in politics and problems faced by
Palestinian physicists, can be found. Feel free to watch the video linked
below, or go read the original essay [cite id="Einstein1949MonRev"].

My take away from both the video and the essay is an observation that in
capitalist society, you can make money through owning stuff only if you pay
laborers less than the value of their labor. To be fair, often the tools are
what enables the labor. Yet without a laborer the tool is often as useless.
Either way, such practice diverts the gains from the improving technology
and other increases in productivity to the pockets of the select few instead
of benefiting society as whole. The worst thing is that having deep pockets,
enables the select few to exert influence over politics and shaping the
society to their will. To break or circumvent check and balances that
should exist in free society.
