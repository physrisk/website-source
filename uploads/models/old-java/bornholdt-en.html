<title>Bornholdt model</title>

</head><body>
<p>The applet below models financial market using Bornholdt model, which was discussed above. Thus meaning of the parameters should be evident from previous discussion.</p>
<p>This applet also has one additional purely computational feature – fast mode. By default applet uses ordinary mode – all figures present in the applet are updated after each iteration. As updating figures takes time, ordinary mode might be too slow to be able to obtain better estimations of model’s statistical properties. In such case you would want to use fast mode, which disables graphical updates. Thus more time and resources can be allocated to modelling itself. In the fast mode figures will be updated as soon as iteration number reaches any multiple of 32768 (or if stop button is pressed). Modelling will be also stopped thereafter. To enable fast mode you must put a check in an appropriate box before starting modelling.</p>
