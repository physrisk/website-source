<p><b>Old comment:</b> Model time series is formed from the numerical solutions of the above difference equations. These time series are used to obtain power spectral density and probabilistic distribution of values (both are ploted on logarithmic scales). Obtained time series mark y values each &Delta;t time units (this &Delta;t is not to be confused with the one in transition probabilities).<br/><br/>
Applet allows to calculate number of time series (or alternatively realizations). Generally speaking the more realizations, the better, as noisy fluctuations are removed through averaging over all calculated realizations. If your computer's processor has multiple cores you can easily increase number of realizations being obtained without significant slowing down - you just have to tell applet to use more cores for numerical calculations. In such case numerical calculations will be distributed over selected number of cores.</p>
