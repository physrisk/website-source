<p>Usage of the applet is very simple – before doing actual evaluation you should input the rule and provide the first, input, generation of cells. Rule can be selected using the form show in Fig. 1 – just press mouse on the second line of cells in the form. First generation of cells might be also set using a mouse – just turn on or off the cells in the first line of the grid. If you do not want to provide first generation manually you can also press the button "Colonize" (the probability of on-cell might be set in the text field nearby).</p>

<p>Next you can evaluate cellular automaton automatically (until the allocated grid ends) by using "Start" button. You can also evaluation generation one by one – just use the button "Iteration". This button might be also used to copy the last line of the grid to the first line and start evaluation a new, namely the brand new grid will be initialized with the last line of the previous grid as its first. In this manner we have obtained Fig. 2 – firstly we have generated random first generation (button "Colonize"), then we have fully evaluated the allocated grid (button "Start"). At this stage we have made a screenshot of the grid, pressed "Iteration" button to initialize new grid with its first generation identical to the last generation of the previous grid and pressed "Start" button to evaluate all of the available generations. Finally we have taken another screenshot and combined them using the graphics editing software to obtain Fig. 2.</p>
